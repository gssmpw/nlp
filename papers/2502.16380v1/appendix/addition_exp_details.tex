In this section we present all the actionability constraints for the datasets used in our experiments. Note that the feature space ${\cal X}$ for each dataset has the same upper and lower bounds as well as non-separable constraints as the action set. All regions we audit in this paper are represented by boxes with fixed values for immutable features.

\subsection{Actionability Constraints for the \textds{heloc} Dataset} 

We show a list of all features and their separable actionability constraints in \cref{Table::IndividualActionSetHeloc}.

\subsection{Computing Infrastructure}
We run all experiments on a personal computer with an Apple M1 Pro chip and 32 GB of RAM. All MILP and MIQCP problems were solved using Gurobi 9.0 \cite{achterberg2019gurobi} with default settings.



\subsection{Additional Results}
\cref{tab:full_results} shows an extended version of our main results that include three additional metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Realized Blindspot Rate}: The fraction of total regions that are predicted to be responsive but contain individuals with fixed predictions in the test dataset.
    \item \textbf{Realized Loophole Rate}: The fraction of total regions that are predicted to be confined but contain individuals with recourse in the test dataset.
    \item \textbf{Computation Time}: The average computation time in seconds over all regions for each dataset.
\end{itemize}

As expected, the \emph{realized} blindspot and loophole rates are lower than the true blindspot and loophole rate. Recourse verification over regions safeguards against rare events (i.e., new individuals with fixed predictions that were not part of the training dataset), which makes the risks less likely to be realized over a small test dataset. However in real-world applications, models are typically deployed and make predictions on datasets much larger than its original training dataset --- increasing the probability of blindspots and loopholes being realized. 

Our extended results also highlight that our approach runs incredibly quickly across all three datasets, auditing a region in under 5 seconds on average. In two out of three datasets, our approach is quicker than the \baseline{Region} which runs pointwise recourse on 100 data points.
