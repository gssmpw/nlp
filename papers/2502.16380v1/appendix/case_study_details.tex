\section{Supplementary Material for Case Study on Pennsylvania SRAI} \label{app:case_study}

In this section we present all the actionability constraints for the Pennsylvania SRAI. Note that the feature space ${\cal X}$ for this setting has the same upper and lower bounds as well as non-separable constraints as the action set. For this case study, we audit a box region that contains any possible offender.

\subsection{Actionability Constraints for the SRAI} 

We show a list of all features and their separable actionability constraints in \cref{Table::IndividualActionSetOGS}.
