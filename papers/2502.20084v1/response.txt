\textbf{Trajectory Prediction For Autonomous Driving.} {
In the field of trajectory prediction, the analysis of prediction performance is often categorized into short-term and long-term horizons ____. Early research employed physical models to represent vehicle motion dynamics, thereby estimating future trajectories. In ____ [1], a trajectory prediction model based on the bicycle model was proposed and successfully applied to an accident warning system. While physical models achieved significant progress in short-term prediction horizons, their inherent simplicity limited their performance in long-term predictions ____. The complexity of human driving behavior, influenced by numerous factors such as cognitive processes, interactions with surrounding vehicles, and environmental conditions, renders long-term prediction a particularly challenging task ____. In response to these challenges, researchers have begun integrating deep learning models to account for these factors in the trajectory prediction process.
Notable prior efforts ____ [2] have explored the complex social dynamics among traffic participants, revealing crucial latent insights that enhance predictive accuracy. Transformer-based models ____ [3] have been increasingly employed for their ability to predict future trajectory distributions effectively. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are also gaining traction for capturing dynamic interactions in complex traffic scenes ____. These approaches primarily focus on understanding the temporal and spatial interplays between traffic agents from historical data to optimize accuracy. Generative models ____, including Variational Auto Encoders (VAEs), Diffusion models, and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), are also being explored for their potential to generate multiple future trajectory possibilities from latent distributions, offering a probabilistic perspective of future paths in this field.}

\textbf{Perceived Safety Concept.} The notion of perceived safety has been a focal point in psychology and physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) studies ____. In pHRI, it is crucial for assessing and representing individuals' perceptions of danger and comfort during interactions with autonomous systems like mobile robots ____, industrial manipulators ____, humanoid robots ____ and AVs ____. Despite its relevance, perceived safety remains a challenging concept to quantify due to its subjective nature ____. Our study breaks new ground in this area by proposing a novel quantitative criterion for perceived safety in self-driving trajectory prediction, drawing from Safety State Metrics (SSMs) and human decision-making processes. This innovation enables our model to more accurately interpret driving behavior and traffic conditions, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy in mixed autonomy environments.

\textbf{Driving Behavior Understanding.} Existing studies in driving behavior have formulated various criteria and metrics for detecting and representing driving patterns, using scales like the Social Value Orientation (SVO) ____, Driving Anger Scale (DAS) ____, among others ____. While these methods have been successful, as noted by ____ [4] and ____, they typically depend on manually annotated labels and predetermined sliding time windows for analysis. Our research diverges from these traditional approaches by proposing a dynamic, adaptive set of behavior-aware criteria. This model captures driving behavior in real-time through continuous behavioral data representation, eliminating the reliance on manual labeling in the training phase. This novel approach not only offers enhanced flexibility over fixed-category methods but also effectively addresses the challenges of label shifts and time window selection, leading to a more accurate and fluid representation of driving behavior. This advancement significantly contributes to the development of more refined and effective behavior prediction methodologies in autonomous driving systems.
