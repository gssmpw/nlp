\begin{abstract}
Large language models (LLMs) often produce incorrect or outdated information, necessitating efficient and precise knowledge updates. Current model editing methods, however, struggle with long-form knowledge in diverse formats, such as poetry, code snippets, and mathematical derivations. These limitations arise from their reliance on editing a single tokenâ€™s hidden state, a limitation we term ``efficacy barrier''. To solve this, we propose \textbf{AnyEdit}, a new autoregressive editing paradigm. It decomposes long-form knowledge into sequential chunks and iteratively edits the key token in each chunk, ensuring consistent and accurate outputs. Theoretically, we ground AnyEdit in the Chain Rule of Mutual Information, showing its ability to update any knowledge within LLMs. Empirically, it outperforms strong baselines by 21.5\% on benchmarks including UnKEBench, AKEW, and our new \textbf{EditEverything} dataset for long-form diverse-formatted knowledge. Additionally, AnyEdit serves as a plug-and-play framework, enabling current editing methods to update knowledge with arbitrary length and format, significantly advancing the scope and practicality of LLM knowledge editing. %Our code is available at: \url{https://github.com/jianghoucheng/AnyEdit}.

% \section*{Accessibility}
% Authors are kindly asked to make their submissions as accessible as possible for everyone including people with disabilities and sensory or neurological differences.
% Tips of how to achieve this and what to pay attention to will be provided on the conference website \url{http://icml.cc/}.

% \section*{Software and Data}

% If a paper is accepted, we strongly encourage the publication of software and data with the
% camera-ready version of the paper whenever appropriate. This can be
% done by including a URL in the camera-ready copy. However, \textbf{do not}
% include URLs that reveal your institution or identity in your
% submission for review. Instead, provide an anonymous URL or upload
% the material as ``Supplementary Material'' into the OpenReview reviewing
% system. Note that reviewers are not required to look at this material
% when writing their review.

% Acknowledgements should only appear in the accepted version.
% \section*{Acknowledgements}

% \textbf{Do not} include acknowledgements in the initial version of
% the paper submitted for blind review.

% If a paper is accepted, the final camera-ready version can (and
% usually should) include acknowledgements.  Such acknowledgements
% should be placed at the end of the section, in an unnumbered section
% that does not count towards the paper page limit. Typically, this will 
% include thanks to reviewers who gave useful comments, to colleagues 
% who contributed to the ideas, and to funding agencies and corporate 
% sponsors that provided financial support.

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% Authors are \textbf{required} to include a statement of the potential 
% broader impact of their work, including its ethical aspects and future 
% societal consequences. This statement should be in an unnumbered 
% section at the end of the paper (co-located with Acknowledgements -- 
% the two may appear in either order, but both must be before References), 
% and does not count toward the paper page limit. In many cases, where 
% the ethical impacts and expected societal implications are those that 
% are well established when advancing the field of Machine Learning, 
% substantial discussion is not required, and a simple statement such 
% as the following will suffice:

% ``This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of 
% Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences 
% of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.''

% The above statement can be used verbatim in such cases, but we 
% encourage authors to think about whether there is content which does 
% warrant further discussion, as this statement will be apparent if the 
% paper is later flagged for ethics review.


% In the unusual situation where you want a paper to appear in the
% references without citing it in the main text, use \nocite
\nocite{}

\bibliographystyle{icml2025}

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
