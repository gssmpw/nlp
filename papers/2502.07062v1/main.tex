% With the explosion of data in modern applications, practical algorithms have garnered increasing attention under various large-scale data settings.
% This work focuses on developing parallel combinatorial approximation algorithms for maximizing a non-monotone submodular function subject to a size constraint $k$
% with a ground set of size $n$.
% The current state-of-the-art approximation ratio for this problem is $1/e$, achieved by
% a continuous algorithm~\citep{Ene2020a} with adaptivity $\oh{\log(n)}$.
% We propose two parallel combinatorial algorithms, both
% achieving $\oh{\log(n)\log(k)}$ adaptivity and 
% $\oh{n\log(n)\log(k)}$ query complexity.
% These algorithms improve the best-known deterministic approximation ratio from $0.125-\epsi$ to $0.25-\epsi$
% and the best-known randomized approximation ratio from $0.25-\epsi$ to $1/e-\epsi\approx 0.367-\epsi$,
% breaking the barrier between continuous and combinatorial approaches.
% Empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods, 
% achieving competitive objective values, 
% with the first algorithm excelling in query efficiency.
With the rapid growth of data in modern applications, parallel combinatorial algorithms 
for maximizing non-monotone submodular functions have gained significant attention.
The state-of-the-art approximation ratio of $1/e$ is 
currently achieved only by a continuous algorithm~\citep{Ene2020a} with adaptivity $\oh{\log(n)}$.
In this work, we focus on size constraints 
and propose a $(1/4-\epsi)$-approximation algorithm 
with high probability for this problem, 
as well as the first randomized parallel combinatorial algorithm
achieving a $1/e-\epsi$ approximation ratio,
which bridges the gap between continuous and combinatorial approaches.
Both algorithms achieve $\oh{\log(n)\log(k)}$ adaptivity and 
$\oh{n\log(n)\log(k)}$ query complexity.
Empirical results show our algorithms achieve competitive objective values, 
with the first algorithm particularly efficient in queries.

\section{Conclusion}
The state-of-the-art $1/e$ approximation ratio for sublinear adaptive algorithms 
is achieved by a continuous algorithm~\citep{Ene2020a}.
For combinatorial algorithms with sublinear adaptivity,
the best-known result is a randomized $1/4$ approximation ratio~\citep{Cui2023}.
In this work, we present a sublinear adaptive approximation algorithm 
achieving $1/4-\epsi$ approximation ratio with high probability,
and further improve this ratio achieved to $1/e$, 
breaking the barrier between continuous and combinatorial algorithms. 
These advancements are made by a novel blending analysis technique,
which offers a fresh perspective for analyzing greedy-based algorithms.
