\section{Conclusion }
In this paper, we introduce VPNeXt, which includes two innovative modules: VCR and ViTUp. The VCR module effectively aligns intermediate features with high-level features by utilizing both local and global context replay. This approach significantly improves representation accuracy without any runtime overhead. Meanwhile, ViTUp is the first method to reveal hidden pyramid features in Plain ViT, enabling the true upsampling of ViT features using real pyramid features for the first time.

We demonstrated the effectiveness of VPNeXt through extensive experiments, and it also broke the long-standing mIoU wall of the VOC2012 by a large margin, which also stands as the largest improvement since 2015.
