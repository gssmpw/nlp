\section{Experiments on Cityscapes Dataset}

Cityscapes is a semantic segmentation dataset featuring high-resolution images of road scenes with precise annotations. 
%
It includes 19 labeled classes and contains 2,975 training images and 500 validation images.
%
We only compare methods trained on the Cityscapes fine annotations, similar to many other works.~\cite{cSegFormer,cKMaXDeepLab}.

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:SOTA-Cityscapes}, our proposed VPNeXt, leveraging ViTUp's strong capabilities, performs comparably to state-of-the-art pyramid-based models (e.g., HFGD~\cite{cHFGD} and DPP~\cite{cDDP}) on high-resolution images.
