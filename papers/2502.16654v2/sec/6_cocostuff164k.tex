\section{Experiments on COCOStuff164k Dataset}

COCOStuff164k has become increasingly popular in recent years and poses a significant challenge for semantic segmentation models due to its high diversity, consisting of 118,000 training images and 5,000 testing images, along with its complexity of 171 classes.

In Table~\ref{tab:SOTA-COCOStuff164k}, our VPNeXt model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, including ViT-Adapter and InternImage, by a significant margin.
