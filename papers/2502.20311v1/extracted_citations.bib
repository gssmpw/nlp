    abstract = {This study investigates Whisper's automatic speech recognition (ASR) system performance across diverse native and non-native English accents. Results reveal superior recognition in American compared to British and Australian English accents with similar performance in Canadian English. Overall, native English accents demonstrate higher accuracy than non-native accents. Exploring connections between speaker traits [sex, native language (L1) typology, and second language (L2) proficiency] and word error rate uncovers notable associations. Furthermore, Whisper exhibits enhanced performance in read speech over conversational speech with modifications based on speaker gender. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

    abstract = "Air traffic control (ATC) is based on voice communication between pilots and controllers and uses a highly task and domain specific language. Due to this very reason, spoken language technologies for ATC require domain-specific corpora, of which only few exist to this day. The ATCOSIM Air Traffic Control Simulation Speech corpus is a speech database of non-prompted and clean ATC operator speech. It consists of ten hours of speech data, which were recorded in typical ATC control room conditions during ATC real-time simulations. The database includes orthographic transcriptions and additional information on speakers and recording sessions. The ATCOSIM corpus is publicly available and provided online free of charge. In this paper, we first give an overview of ATC related corpora and their shortcomings. We then show the difficulties in obtaining operational ATC speech recordings and propose the use of existing ATC real-time simulations. We describe the recording, transcription, production and validation process of the ATCOSIM corpus, and outline an application example for automatic speech recognition in the ATC domain."

	abstract = {Automatic dialog interaction with remote interlocutors is a difﬁcult application area for speech recognition technology because of the limited acoustic context, poor signal representation, high variability of spontaneous speech and limited time available to do the recognition of noncanonical spoken production. We present the speech recognition system for the non-native dialog applications that we are currently developing. We ﬁnd that our system broadly matches human performance; that minimum Bayes risk decoding improves accuracy, and that the posterior probabilities have good power towards predicting errors. We also explore the temporal distribution of errors made by the recognizer with online speaker adaptation, the frequency of errors among auto-semantic and function words, as well as the distribution of error rates among the heterogeneous speaker population. Our ﬁndings motivate further development directions for dialog speech recognition systems.},

	abstract = {Increasing air traffic creates many challenges for ATM. A general answer to these challenges is to increase automation. However, communication between air traffic controllers (ATCos) and pilots is widely analog and far away from digital ATM components. As communication content is important for the ATM system, commands are entered manually by the ATCo, to enable the ATM system to react to the communication. However, the disadvantage is an additional workload of ATCos. To avoid this effort automatic speech recognition (ASR) can automatically analyze the communication and extract the content of commands. To achieve low failure rates, DLR together with Saarland University invented the AcListant® system, the first assistant based speech recognition (ABSR). AcListant® validation trials reveal also shortcomings, like problems with the costly adaptations of the recognizer to specific environments. SESAR 2020 Exploratory Research funded project MALORCA developed machine learning algorithms to automatically adapt ABSR to different airports. SESAR Industrial Research funded solution PJ 16-04 developed an ontology for ATC command transcription to enable reuse of expensive manually transcribed ATC communication. Finally, results and experiences are used in SESAR Wave-2 Solutions 96 and 97. This paper presents the evolution from AcListant® via MALORCA, PJ.16-04 to Wave-2 Solutions 96 and 97.},
