\subsection{World Models}

Model-based RL improves sample efficiency over model-free RL by learning an approximate model for the transition dynamics of the environment, allowing for policy training without interacting with the environment itself. However, obtaining accurate world models is not straightforward because the learned model can easily accumulate errors exponentially over time. To alleviate this issue, ____ designs ensembles of stochastic dynamics models to attempt to incorporate uncertainty. The Dreamer architecture____ learns a model of the environment via reconstructing the input from a latent space using the recurrent state-space model (RSSM). The RSSM incorporates the Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) network____ and the Variational Autoencoder (VAE)____ for modeling. With this generative world model, the policy is trained with imagined trajectories in this learned latent space.  ____ and ____ leverage the Transformer architecture____ to autoregressively model the world dynamics and similarly train the policy in latent imagination. 
Our work is built on top of the Dreamer architecture, but the idea of explicit modeling of hidden parameters has the potential to be combined with other architectures.

\subsection{Randomized Approaches without Explicit Modeling}
One of the most popular approaches to deal with uncertain or parameterized dynamics is domain randomization (DR), which aims to improve the robustness of a policy by exposing the agent to randomized environments. It has been effective in many applications, including manipulation ____, locomotion ____, autonomous driving ____, and indoor drone flying ____. 
% \sehoon{assign citations to the proper application category}. 
Domain randomization has also shown great success in deploying trained policies on actual robots, such as performing sim-to-real transfer for a quadrupedal robot in ____ and improving performance for a robotic manipulator in ____. ____ and ____ both incorporate DR for increased robustness in a world model setting. While DR is highly effective in many situations, it tends to lead to an overly conservative policy that is suboptimal for challenging problems with a wide range of transition or reward functions. 

\subsection{Domain Adaptation}
Since incorporating additional observations is often beneficial ____, another common strategy for dealing with variable environments is to incorporate the hidden environmental parameters into the policy for adaptation. This privileged information of the hidden parameters can be exploited during training, but at test time, system identification must occur online. For model-free RL, researchers typically train a universal policy conditioned on hidden parameters and estimate them at test time by identifying directly from a history of observations____. Another option is to improve state estimation while training in diverse environments, which similarly allows for adaptation without needing to perform explicit system identification____. 
% \sehoon{Morgan, check the descriptions and adjust them.} 
For model-based RL, the problem of handling variable physics conditions is handled in multiple ways. A few research groups ____ propose using meta-learning to rapidly adapt to environmental changes online. ____ uses a graph-based meta RL technique to handle changing dynamics. ____ used data augmentation in offline RL to get zero-shot dynamics generalization. The most applicable methods for our work are those that use a learned encoder to estimate a context vector that attempts to capture the environmental information. Then, this context vector is used for conditioning the policy and forward prediction, as in ____.
