\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we introduce \ours, a novel framework designed to achieve lossless acceleration in generating ultra-long sequences with \acp{llm}. By analyzing and addressing three challenges, \ours significantly enhances the efficiency of the generation process. Our experimental results demonstrate that \ours achieves over $3\times$ acceleration across various model scales and architectures. Furthermore, \ours effectively mitigates issues related to repetitive content, ensuring the quality and coherence of the generated sequences. These advancements position \ours as a scalable and effective solution for ultra-long sequence generation tasks.
