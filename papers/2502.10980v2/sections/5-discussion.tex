\section{Discussion}
% We introduced the combination method of motion representation and reinforcement learning to deploy not only high tracking imitation and natural transition but also enabling another task during dancing. We show the higher tracking accuracy than baseline of \ac{fld}. ****.

% However, tracking accuracy is reduced by each block such as motion representation and reinforcement learning as described in Fig.X. For example, depending on the usecase such as no need for multi task and robustness but need for more tracking accuracy for artistic motion primitives, we can choose decoded motion to deploy in the entertainment robots. Although the learning method are promising way to create more variety of motion in robust manner, it is always trade-off for the tracking accuracy for artistic motions.
