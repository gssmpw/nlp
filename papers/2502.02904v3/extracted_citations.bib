    abstract = "Recent work in training large language models (LLMs) to follow natural language instructions has opened up exciting opportunities for natural language interface design. Building on the prior success of large language models in the realm of computer assisted creativity, in this work, we present \textit{CoPoet}, a collaborative poetry writing system, with the goal of to study if LLM{'}s actually improve the quality of the generated content. In contrast to auto-completing a user{'}s text, CoPoet is controlled by user instructions that specify the attributes of the desired text, such as \textit{Write a sentence about {`}love{'}} or \textit{Write a sentence ending in {`}fly{'}}. The core component of our system is a language model fine-tuned on a diverse collection of instructions for poetry writing. Our model is not only competitive to publicly available LLMs trained on instructions (InstructGPT), but also capable of satisfying unseen compositional instructions. A study with 15 qualified crowdworkers shows that users successfully write poems with CoPoet on diverse topics ranging from \textit{Monarchy} to \textit{Climate change}, which are preferred by third-party evaluators over poems written without the system.",

The data is drawn from real reviewer-author interactions from computer science, and we provide labels linking each reviewer comment to the specific paper edits made by the author in response. We automatically create a high-precision silver training set, as well as an expert-labeled test set that shows high inter-annotator agreement. In experiments with 10 models covering the state of the art, we find that they struggle even to identify which edits correspond to a comment{---}especially when the relationship between the edit and the comment is indirect and requires reasoning to uncover. We also extensively analyze GPT-4{'}s ability to generate edits given a comment and the original paper. We find that it often succeeds on a superficial level, but tends to rigidly follow the wording of the feedback rather than the underlying intent, and lacks technical details compared to human-written edits.",

Previous works on text revision have focused on defining edit intention taxonomies within a single domain or developing computational models with a single level of edit granularity, such as sentence-level edits, which differ from human{'}s revision cycles. This work describes IteraTeR: the first large-scale, multi-domain, edit-intention annotated corpus of iteratively revised text. In particular, IteraTeR is collected based on a new framework to comprehensively model the iterative text revisions that generalizes to a variety of domains, edit intentions, revision depths, and granularities. When we incorporate our annotated edit intentions, both generative and action-based text revision models significantly improve automatic evaluations. Through our work, we better understand the text revision process, making vital connections between edit intentions and writing quality, enabling the creation of diverse corpora to support computational modeling of iterative text revisions.",

    abstract = "Scientific publications are the primary means to communicate research discoveries, where the writing quality is of crucial importance. However, prior work studying the human editing process in this domain mainly focused on the abstract or introduction sections, resulting in an incomplete picture. In this work, we provide a complete computational framework for studying text revision in scientific writing. We first introduce arXivEdits, a new annotated corpus of 751 full papers from arXiv with gold sentence alignment across their multiple versions of revision, as well as fine-grained span-level edits and their underlying intentions for 1,000 sentence pairs. It supports our data-driven analysis to unveil the common strategies practiced by researchers for revising their papers. To scale up the analysis, we also develop automatic methods to extract revision at document-, sentence-, and word-levels. A neural CRF sentence alignment model trained on our corpus achieves 93.8 F1, enabling the reliable matching of sentences between different versions. We formulate the edit extraction task as a span alignment problem, and our proposed method extracts more fine-grained and explainable edits, compared to the commonly used diff algorithm. An intention classifier trained on our dataset achieves 78.9 F1 on the fine-grained intent classification task. Our data and system are released at tiny.one/arxivedits.",

The previous dataset was constructed entirely with Tex-formatted papers, from which it is easy to extract citation information. However, since many publicly available papers in various fields are provided only in PDF format, a dataset constructed using only Tex papers has limited utility. To resolve this problem, we augment the existing dataset by extracting the titles of sections using the visual features of PDF documents and extracting the Related Work section text using the explicit title information. Since text generated from the figures and footnotes appearing in the extraction target areas is considered noise, we remove instances of such text. Moreover, we map the cited paper{'}s information obtained using existing tools to citation marks detected by regular expression rules, resulting in pairs of cited paper information and text of the Related Work section. By evaluating body text extraction and citation mapping in the constructed dataset, the accuracy of the proposed dataset was found to be close to that of the previous dataset. Accordingly, we demonstrated the possibility of building a significantly augmented dataset.",
