\subsection{Risk Adaptability}
\label{sec:risk_adaptability}


Fig. \ref{fig:risks_variation_both_metrics_all_risks} shows the average distance to obstacles, path duration, and total energy consumption for Pareto front trajectories, analyzed as functions of three mission risks: battery, wind, and GPS. These risks were varied from 0 to 1 in 0.1 increments in Env.2 to isolate sensitivity to each risk. Communication risk was excluded as it mirrors localization risk in Eq. \ref{eq:coefficient_adjustment_functions}. Results indicate that with high battery risk, the planner prioritizes trajectories with path duration and energy consumption closest to benchmarks. With wind or localization risks, it prioritizes trajectories with obstacle distances closest to the safety benchmark. The planner’s trajectories span the full benchmark range for path duration and energy consumption, and 95.6\% for obstacle distance. Similar results across seven environments confirmed the algorithm’s adaptive weighting based on varying risks.
