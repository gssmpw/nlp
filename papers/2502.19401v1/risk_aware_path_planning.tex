\section{Adaptive Risk-Aware Path Planning}
\label{sec:risk_aware_path_planning}

We begin this section by defining the multi-objective path planning problem. We present the decision vector, the continuous path representation method, and the objectives in Section \ref{sec:risk_aware_path_planning_problem_definition}. Section \ref{sec:risk_aware_path_planning_solver} shows our adaptive risk-aware multi-objective path planning method, including our multi-objective solver and how we initialize it, the voting algorithm, the real-time adjustment of its coefficients, and the hyperparameters of the entire path planning method.
