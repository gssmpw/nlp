\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

We begin this section by presenting the experiment setup for simulated and real-world flight tests. Section \ref{sec:simulated_experiments} details our algorithm's performance compared to single-objective optimal behaviors through a parametric sensitivity analysis of the cost function coefficients. In Section \ref{sec:risk_adaptability} we discuss the algorithm's adaptability to different risk scenarios. Finally, overall behavior in real-world flight tests and power consumption model validations are presented and discussed in Section \ref{sec:physical_experiment}.
