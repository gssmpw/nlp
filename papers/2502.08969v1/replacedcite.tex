\section{Related Work}
Extensive progress has been made in solving MAPF for single-domain vehicles____. 
Previous simulators such as ____ have tackled various forms of agent-based simulation, yet few focus on integrated UAV-AGV scenarios. 
Moreover, many existing platforms concentrate on either 2D grids or simplified 3D representations, limiting the study of aerial and ground interactions. 
By contrast, \texttt{SkyRover} explicitly targets these cross-domain concerns, offering realistic physics, 3D occupancy grids, and unified APIs. 
To our knowledge, it is the first environment to natively support collaborative UAV-AGV MAPF under a single, modular framework.
