\section{Various Reward Function Designs} 
\label{appendix_reward}
{We can shape the reward function with verifiers in several different ways, with the following designs of the reward function.} 


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Immediate Verification Reward}: The immediate verification reward is defined as \( R_{\btheta} (q, s_{ta}) = \EE[\text{Verifier}(q, s_{ta})] \). This reward is based on the verifier's immediate evaluation of the solution \( s_{ta} \) at turn \( t \) for agent \( a \). It reflects the instantaneous correctness of the solution without considering future steps or contributions from other agents.

    \item \textbf{Cumulative Verification Reward}: The cumulative verification reward is given by 
    \[
    R_{\btheta} (q, s_{ta}) = \EE\left[ \frac{1}{\sum_{t' \in [t, T]} \gamma^{t'-t}} \sum_{t' \in [t, T]} \gamma^{t'-t}\text{Verifier}(q, s_{t'a})\right].
    \]
    Here, the reward accounts for the verifier's evaluations across all remaining turns from \( t \) to the final turn \( T \). The term \( \gamma^{t'-t} \) represents a discount factor that prioritizes earlier rewards. This cumulative approach encourages solutions that not only perform well in the immediate turn but also lead to favorable outcomes in subsequent turns.

    \item \textbf{Influence-aware Verification Reward}: The influence-aware verification reward function is defined as 
\begin{align*}
    &R_{\btheta}(q, s_{ta}) = \EE \bigg[\frac{1}{\sum_{t' \in [t, T]} \gamma^{t'-t}} \biggl( \text{Verifier}(q, s_{ta}) 
    \\
    &\, + \sum_{t' \in [t+1, T]}\sum_{j \in [A]} \frac{1}{A}\gamma^{t'-t}\text{Verifier}(q, s_{t'j})\biggr) \bigg].  
\end{align*}
    This reward not only considers the verifier's score for the current solution \( s_{ta} \) but also incorporates the impact of this solution on the future answers of all agents. The term \( \sum_{j \in [A]} \frac{1}{A} \) averages the verifier's scores across all agents, reflecting the influence that \( s_{ta} \) has on the collective progress of the multi-agent system.
\end{itemize}
