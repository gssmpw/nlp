\begin{abstract}
  Process-based learning is crucial for the transmission of intangible cultural heritage, especially in complex arts like Chinese calligraphy, where mastering techniques cannot be achieved by merely observing the final work. To explore the challenges faced in calligraphy heritage transmission, we conducted semi-structured interviews (N=8) as a formative study. Our findings indicate that the lack of calligraphy instructors and tools makes it difficult for students to master brush techniques, and teachers struggle to convey the intricate details and rhythm of brushwork. To address this, we collaborated with calligraphy instructors to develop an educational tool that integrates writing process capture and visualization, showcasing the writing rhythm, hand force, and brush posture. Through empirical studies conducted in multiple teaching workshops, we evaluated the system's effectiveness with teachers (N=4) and students (N=12). The results show that the tool significantly enhances teaching efficiency and aids learners in better understanding brush techniques.

  \caption{An overview the visual teaching assistant system for the entire calligraphy process begins with the user writing in a real scenario, where sensors and cameras capture the entire writing process. The captured strokes will then undergo a series of data processing steps, including temporal alignment, stroke segmentation, skeleton extraction, etc., and the captured writing parameters will correspond one-to-one with their own dots. CalliSense will visualize these parameters and has comparison features for both students and teachers, ultimately helping students enhance their awareness of brushwork and understand the details of stroke execution.}
