Despite the success of MLLMs, emerging research highlights their struggles with reasoning. **Hermann**, "Learning to Reason" find that vision-language models struggle to negate in retrieval and multiple-choice tasks. Beyond general reasoning, open-source, closed-source, and math-specific MLLMs perform poorly on visual math benchmarks ____.

A key limitation in MLLMs is the vision encoder. **Radford**, "Learning to Generate" show CLIP-based vision encoders fail to capture fine-grained details \textemdash a detrimental trait for tasks requiring precise visual reasoning. Similarly, in the visual-mathematics domain, ____ demonstrate that vision encoders produce inadequate representations of mathematical diagrams and vision-text misalignments  hinder multimodal reasoning.

One way to address these challenges is fine-tuning. Recent works adopt a multi-step approach: (1) fine-tuning vision encoders to enhance visual representation, (2) training modality projectors for better alignment, and (3) instruction-tuning with CoT datasets _____. While this may increase performance on math benchmarks, studies show that fine-tuning foundation models often reduces generalization ability and does not address overarching reasoning capability ____.

In the language domain, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has proven highly effective in encouraging System 2 reasoning in LLMs _____. ____ further reinforces this, demonstrating that structuring reasoning through CoT can significantly improve logical inference and problem-solving. However, applying CoT to MLLMs has been far less successful. ____ show that open-source MLLMs struggle with CoT, largely due to limitations in existing visual-instruction tuning datasets, which prioritize short, simplistic responses over structured reasoning. Thus, recent works explicitly fine-tune MLLMs for CoT reasoning, particularly in object counting and mathematical reasoning tasks _____. However, even these fine-tuned models continue to struggle on complex visual-mathematical benchmarks such as MathVista **Alcorn**, "MathVista: A Large-Scale Dataset for Visual-Mathematical Reasoning"_____, and MathVerse **Hermann**, "MathVerse: A Visual-Mathematics Benchmark"_____. These challenges highlight that despite recent efforts, System 2 reasoning in MLLMs remains an open problem, with current approaches failing to achieve generalizable reasoning abilities.
