abstract = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) rely on optical sensors such as cameras and lidar for autonomous operation. However, such optical sensors are error-prone in bad lighting, inclement weather conditions including fog and smoke, and around textureless or transparent surfaces. In this paper, we ask: is it possible to fly UAVs without relying on optical sensors, i.e., can UAVs fly without seeing? We present BatMobility, a lightweight mmWave radar-only perception system for UAVs that eliminates the need for optical sensors. BatMobility enables two core functionalities for UAVs - radio flow estimation (a novel FMCW radar-based alternative for optical flow based on surface-parallel doppler shift) and radar-based collision avoidance. We build BatMobility using commodity sensors and deploy it as a real-time system on a small off-the-shelf quadcopter running an unmodified flight controller. Our evaluation1 shows that BatMobility achieves comparable or better performance than commercial-grade optical sensors across a wide range of scenarios.},

abstract = {A wide range of advanced deep learning algorithms have recently been proposed for image classification and object detection. However, the effectiveness of these methods can be significantly restricted in many real-world scenarios where the visibility or illumination is poor. Compared to RGB cameras, millimeter-wave (mmWave) radars are immune to the above environmental variability and can assist cameras under adverse conditions. To this end, we propose milliEye, a lightweight mmWave radar and camera fusion system for robust object detection on the edge platforms. milliEye has several key advantages over existing sensor fusion approaches. First, while milliEye fuses two sensing modalities in a learning-based fashion, it requires only a small amount of labeled image/radar data of a new scene as it can fully utilize large public image datasets for extensive training. This salient feature enables milliEye to adapt to highly complex real-world environments. Second, based on a novel architecture that decouples the image-based object detector from other modules, milliEye is compatible with different off-the-shelf image-based object detectors. As a result, it can take advantage of the rapid progress of object detection algorithms. Moreover, thanks to the highly compute-efficient fusion approach, milliEye is lightweight and thus suitable for edge-based real-time applications. To evaluate the performance of milliEye, we collect a new radar and camera fusion dataset for object detection, which contains both ordinary-light and low-light illumination conditions. The results show that milliEye can provide substantial performance boosts over state-of-the-art image-based object detectors, including Tiny YOLOv3 and SSD, especially in low-light scenes, while incurring low compute overhead on edge platforms.},

abstract = {Mobile Augmented Reality (AR) demands realistic rendering of virtual content that seamlessly blends into the physical environment. For this reason, AR headsets and recent smartphones are increasingly equipped with Time-of-Flight (ToF) cameras to acquire depth maps of a scene in real-time. ToF cameras are cheap and fast, however, they suffer from several issues that affect the quality of depth data, ultimately hampering their use for mobile AR. Among them, scale errors of virtual objects - appearing much bigger or smaller than what they should be - are particularly noticeable and unpleasant. This article specifically addresses these challenges by proposing InDepth, a real-time depth inpainting system based on edge computing. InDepth employs a novel deep neural network (DNN) architecture to improve the accuracy of depth maps obtained from ToF cameras. The DNN fills holes and corrects artifacts in the depth maps with high accuracy and eight times lower inference time than the state of the art. An extensive performance evaluation in real settings shows that InDepth reduces the mean absolute error by a factor of four with respect to ARCore DepthLab. Finally, a user study reveals that InDepth is effective in rendering correctly-scaled virtual objects, outperforming DepthLab.},

This unequivocal and widespread presence of amateur drones may cause many dangers, such as privacy breaches by reaching sensitive locations of authorities and individuals. In this paper, we summarize the performance-affecting factors and major obstacles to drone use and provide a brief background of deep learning. Then, we summarize the types of UAVs and the related unethical behaviors, safety, privacy, and cybersecurity concerns. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review of current drone detection methods based on deep learning. This area of research has arisen in the last two decades because of the rapid advancement of commercial and recreational drones and their combined risk to the safety of airspace. Various deep learning algorithms and their frameworks with respect to the techniques used to detect drones and their areas of applications are also discussed. Drone detection techniques are classified into four categories: visual, radar, acoustics, and radio frequency-based approaches. The findings of this study prove that deep learning-based detection and classification of drones looks promising despite several challenges. Finally, we provide some recommendations to meet future expectations.}

ABSTRACT = {This work presents an autonomous vision-based mobile target tracking and following system designed for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) leveraging multi-target information. It explores the research gap in applying the most recent multi-object tracking (MOT) methods in target following scenarios over traditional single-object tracking (SOT) algorithms. The system integrates the real-time object detection model, You Only Look Once (YOLO)v8, with the MOT algorithms BoT-SORT and ByteTrack, extracting multi-target information. It leverages this information to improve redetection capabilities, addressing target misidentifications (ID changes), and partial and full occlusions in dynamic environments. A depth sensing module is incorporated to enhance distance estimation when feasible. A 3D flight control system is proposed for target following, capable of reacting to changes in target speed and direction while maintaining line-of-sight. The system is initially tested in simulation and then deployed in real-world scenarios. Results show precise target tracking and following, resilient to partial and full occlusions in dynamic environments, effectively distinguishing the followed target from bystanders. A comparison between the BoT-SORT and ByteTrack trackers reveals a trade-off between computational efficiency and tracking precision. In overcoming the presented challenges, this work enables new practical applications in the field of vision-based target following from UAVs leveraging multi-target information.},

abstract = {Core to drone design is its ability to ascertain its location by utilizing onboard inertial sensors combined with GPS data. However, GPS is not always reachable, especially in challenging environments such as indoors. This paper proposes RaDro; a system that leverages millimeter-waves (mmWave) to precisely localize and track drones in indoor environments. Unlike commonly used alternative technologies, RaDro is cost-effective and can penetrate obstacles, a bonus in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, which enhances its reliability for tracking objects in complex environments. It does this without the need for tags or anchors to be attached to the drone, achieving 3D tracking with just a single radar point, significantly streamlining the deployment process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in different scenarios to evaluate RaDro's performance. These include employing different drone models with different sizes to execute a range of aerial manoeuvres across different flight arenas, each with its own settings and clutter, and encountering various LoS and NLoS scenarios in dynamic environments. The experiments aimed to assess the capabilities of the system to extract coarse-grained and fine-grained information for drone detection, motion recognition, and localization. The results showcase precise localization, achieving a 50\% reduction in localization error compared to the conventional baseline. This localization accuracy remains resilient even when confronted with interference from other moving sources. The results also demonstrate the system's ability to accurately localize drones in NLoS scenarios where existing state-of-the-art optical technologies cannot work.},

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a framework for simultaneous tracking and recognizing drone targets using a low-cost and small-sized millimeter-wave radar is presented. The radar collects the reflected signals of multiple targets in the field of view, including drone and non-drone targets. The analysis of the received signals allows multiple targets to be distinguished because of their different reflection patterns. The proposed framework consists of four processes: signal processing, cloud point clustering, target tracking, and target recognition. Signal processing translates the raw collected signals into spare cloud points. These points are merged into several clusters, each representing a single target in three-dimensional space. Target tracking estimates the new location of each detected target. A novel convolutional neural network model was designed to extract and recognize the features of drone and non-drone targets. For the performance evaluation, a dataset collected with an IWR6843ISK mmWave sensor by Texas Instruments was used for training and testing the convolutional neural network. The proposed recognition model achieved accuracies of 98.4% and 98.1% for one and two targets, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Human gesture detection, obstacle detection, collision avoidance, parking aids, automotive driving, medical, meteorological, industrial, agriculture, defense, space, and other relevant fields have all benefited from recent advancements in mmWave radar sensor technology. A mmWave radar has several advantages that set it apart from other types of sensors. A mmWave radar can operate in bright, dazzling, or no-light conditions. A mmWave radar has better antenna miniaturization than other traditional radars, and it has better range resolution. However, as more data sets have been made available, there has been a significant increase in the potential for incorporating radar data into different machine learning methods for various applications. This review focuses on key performance metrics in mmWave-radar-based sensing, detailed applications, and machine learning techniques used with mmWave radar for a variety of tasks. This article starts out with a discussion of the various working bands of mmWave radars, then moves on to various types of mmWave radars and their key specifications, mmWave radar data interpretation, vast applications in various domains, and, in the end, a discussion of machine learning algorithms applied with radar data for various applications. Our review serves as a practical reference for beginners developing mmWave-radar-based applications by utilizing machine learning techniques.},
