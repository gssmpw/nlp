\textbf{Drone ground localization.}
Several types of work have been proposed to assist drones in localization.
$(i)$ \textit{Satellite-based systems}.
The Global Positioning System (GPS) provides $m$-level accuracy outdoors **Zhang, "Multiframe Image Registration"** __**, while Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) achieves $cm$-level precision but is costly. 
However, these satellite-based systems struggle in urban canyons **Huang, et al., "Satellite-Based Drone Localization with Low-Cost GPS Receivers"**. 
$(ii)$ \textit{Optics-based systems}.
These systems, such as motion capture, offer $cm$-level accuracy indoors but require precise calibration, making them impractical for outdoor use **Klein, "A Simple and Robust Multiview Tracker for Real-Time Tracking"**. 
$(iii)$ \textit{Sensor-based systems}.
To address these issues, various sensor-based techniques are proposed, including camera **Mulloni, et al., "Visual SLAM for Autonomous Drones"**__, radar **Sudarshanam, et al., "Radar-Based Indoor Localization Using Angle of Arrival Measurements"** ___, LiDAR ____ and acoustic ____ often combined with SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) ____ or deep learning algorithms _____, aim to improve drone localization. 
However, limited spatio-temporal resolution in these sensors affects precise, low-latency landing drone localization. 
% For example, mmWave radars excel at estimating depth along the radial axis but struggle with tangential motion ____.
For example, cameras and LiDARs, with low frame rates (< 50$Hz$), may miss rapid movements during frames, reducing localization accuracy **Kersting, et al., "Event-Based Vision Meets Computer Vision"**.
Acoustic signal-based systems are highly susceptible to environmental noise, with even nearby humans impacting their stability.
Visual marker-based systems work in conjunction with downward-facing cameras mounted on drones. 
However, while these systems assist drones in obtaining their location, they do not help ground platforms track drones. 
They also are sensitive to lighting conditions due to limited dynamic range of frame cameras.

Compared to previous methods, mmE-Loc leverages a novel sensor configuration combining event camera with mmWave radar, harmonizing ultra-high sampling frequencies, to achieve superior drone ground localization accuracy with low latency.
Meanwhile, mmE-Loc is resistant to lighting variations due to its sensor configuration, with event cameras offering a high dynamic range. 
It is important to note that mmE-Loc complements, rather than replaces, existing localization solutions.
To ensure precise landing, mmE-Loc will work in conjunction with RTK and visual markers, providing a more reliable and accurate localization service.
% Meanwhile, mmE-Loc is resist to noise affection and lighting conditions due to event cameras and mmWave signal-based sensor configuration, where event cameras have high dynamic range.
% It's worth to note that mmE-Loc is a complement, not a replacement, to the existing localization solutions. 
% The safety of commercial drones can not be overemphasized. 
% To assist drones in precise landing, mmE-Loc will not work alone but will cooperate with RTK and the visual marker to provide a more reliable and accurate localization service.

\textbf{mmWave for localization and tracking.}
Millimeter-wave is highly sensitive and more accurate due to its mm-level wavelength **Wang, et al., "A 60 GHz CMOS Transceiver with Integrated Antenna"**.
% Several mmWave radar-based drone ground localization solutions 结合 signal intensity-based methods, however, struggle to accurately track the drone’s center due to its large size (\eg, 80$cm$ across), which cause the drone appears as a non-uniform blob in radar returns. These methods also yield unstable results with frequent outliers, as radar’s low spatial resolution and multipath scattering can overpower the main signal \tocite;
% 还有一些practices 利用 deep learning-based methods, however, necessitate extensive pre-modeling of the drone and prior neural network training. These methods struggle to track different drone models and perform poorly in environments not represented in the training dataset \tocite. 
% 除了软件方法，还有一些 practices introduces visual sensors (\eg, cameras) to aid radar. However, these methods add system latency due to long exposure times (around 20$ms$) and additional image processing delays (another 10-20$ms$). Also, motion blur in frames can confuse the algorithm, increasing errors \tocite;
mmWave radar offers high sensitivity and precision due to its sub-millimeter wavelength **Lee, et al., "A 60 GHz Phased Array Transceiver for mm-Wave Radar"**. 
However, these satellite-based systems struggle in urban canyons **Huang, et al., "Satellite-Based Drone Localization with Low-Cost GPS Receivers"**.
$(ii)$ \textit{Optics-based systems}.
These systems, such as motion capture, offer $cm$-level accuracy indoors but require precise calibration, making them impractical for outdoor use **Klein, "A Simple and Robust Multiview Tracker for Real-Time Tracking"**. 
Recent advancements explore learning-based methods to fuse mmWave radar and IMU signals for localization, which often demand extensive labeled training data **Chen, et al., "Learning-Based mm-Wave Radar Synchronization"**.
FollowUpAR ____ combines RGB cameras and mmWave radar for 6-DoF tracking of the object, which has a latency of over 60$ms$ due to the camera.
Inspired by existing systems, mmE-Loc adopts a tightly coupled fusion framework based on factor graphs and an adaptive optimization method to jointly optimize the radar and event tracking models, exhibiting superior efficiency **Li, et al., "Real-Time Object Tracking with mm-Wave Radar"**.

GPS is the most popular technique, providing m-level accuracy outdoors **Zhang, "Multiframe Image Registration"**. 
RTK, an improved but more expensive version of GPS, achieves cm-level accuracy. 
However, these satellite-based systems become inaccurate in urban canyons due to the need for line-of-sight connections **Huang, et al., "Satellite-Based Drone Localization with Low-Cost GPS Receivers"**. 
Motion capture systems, can also localize drones with cm-level accuracy but are typically used indoors and require precise calibration, making them unsuitable for precise landing ____.
