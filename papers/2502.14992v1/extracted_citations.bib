abstract = {Core to drone design is its ability to ascertain its location by utilizing onboard inertial sensors combined with GPS data. However, GPS is not always reachable, especially in challenging environments such as indoors. This paper proposes RaDro; a system that leverages millimeter-waves (mmWave) to precisely localize and track drones in indoor environments. Unlike commonly used alternative technologies, RaDro is cost-effective and can penetrate obstacles, a bonus in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios, which enhances its reliability for tracking objects in complex environments. It does this without the need for tags or anchors to be attached to the drone, achieving 3D tracking with just a single radar point, significantly streamlining the deployment process. Comprehensive experiments are conducted in different scenarios to evaluate RaDro's performance. These include employing different drone models with different sizes to execute a range of aerial manoeuvres across different flight arenas, each with its own settings and clutter, and encountering various LoS and NLoS scenarios in dynamic environments. The experiments aimed to assess the capabilities of the system to extract coarse-grained and fine-grained information for drone detection, motion recognition, and localization. The results showcase precise localization, achieving a 50\% reduction in localization error compared to the conventional baseline. This localization accuracy remains resilient even when confronted with interference from other moving sources. The results also demonstrate the system's ability to accurately localize drones in NLoS scenarios where existing state-of-the-art optical technologies cannot work.},

abstract = {As a new type of aerial robotics, drones are easy to use and inexpensive, which has facilitated their acquisition by individuals and organizations. This unequivocal and widespread presence of amateur drones may cause many dangers, such as privacy breaches by reaching sensitive locations of authorities and individuals. In this paper, we summarize the performance-affecting factors and major obstacles to drone use and provide a brief background of deep learning. Then, we summarize the types of UAVs and the related unethical behaviors, safety, privacy, and cybersecurity concerns. Then, we present a comprehensive literature review of current drone detection methods based on deep learning. This area of research has arisen in the last two decades because of the rapid advancement of commercial and recreational drones and their combined risk to the safety of airspace. Various deep learning algorithms and their frameworks with respect to the techniques used to detect drones and their areas of applications are also discussed. Drone detection techniques are classified into four categories: visual, radar, acoustics, and radio frequency-based approaches. The findings of this study prove that deep learning-based detection and classification of drones looks promising despite several challenges. Finally, we provide some recommendations to meet future expectations.}

ABSTRACT = {In this paper, a framework for simultaneous tracking and recognizing drone targets using a low-cost and small-sized millimeter-wave radar is presented. The radar collects the reflected signals of multiple targets in the field of view, including drone and non-drone targets. The analysis of the received signals allows multiple targets to be distinguished because of their different reflection patterns. The proposed framework consists of four processes: signal processing, cloud point clustering, target tracking, and target recognition. Signal processing translates the raw collected signals into spare cloud points. These points are merged into several clusters, each representing a single target in three-dimensional space. Target tracking estimates the new location of each detected target. A novel convolutional neural network model was designed to extract and recognize the features of drone and non-drone targets. For the performance evaluation, a dataset collected with an IWR6843ISK mmWave sensor by Texas Instruments was used for training and testing the convolutional neural network. The proposed recognition model achieved accuracies of 98.4% and 98.1% for one and two targets, respectively.},

ABSTRACT = {Human gesture detection, obstacle detection, collision avoidance, parking aids, automotive driving, medical, meteorological, industrial, agriculture, defense, space, and other relevant fields have all benefited from recent advancements in mmWave radar sensor technology. A mmWave radar has several advantages that set it apart from other types of sensors. A mmWave radar can operate in bright, dazzling, or no-light conditions. A mmWave radar has better antenna miniaturization than other traditional radars, and it has better range resolution. However, as more data sets have been made available, there has been a significant increase in the potential for incorporating radar data into different machine learning methods for various applications. This review focuses on key performance metrics in mmWave-radar-based sensing, detailed applications, and machine learning techniques used with mmWave radar for a variety of tasks. This article starts out with a discussion of the various working bands of mmWave radars, then moves on to various types of mmWave radars and their key specifications, mmWave radar data interpretation, vast applications in various domains, and, in the end, a discussion of machine learning algorithms applied with radar data for various applications. Our review serves as a practical reference for beginners developing mmWave-radar-based applications by utilizing machine learning techniques.},
