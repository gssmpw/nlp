\section{Conclusion}\label{7}
% In this paper, we present the design and implementation of mmE-Loc, the first framework that enhances mmWave radar with event cameras to support accurate and low-latency drone ground localization.
% In this paper, we explore a fresh sensor configuration, event camera plus mmWave radar, that embraces and harmonizes ultra-high sampling frequencies and propose mmE-Loc, a ground localization system for drone landings that delivers $cm$ accuracy and $ms$ latency.
% This paper explores a novel sensor configuration combining event camera and mmWave radar, harmonizing ultra-high sampling frequencies, and proposes mmE-Loc, a ground localization system for landing drone that   achieves $cm$ accuracy and $ms$ latency.
% The innovation of mmE-Loc lies in two aspects: 
% $(i)$ a Consistency-Instructed Collaborative Tracking module leverages cross-modal \textit{temporal consistency}, achieving accurate drone detection.
% $(ii)$ a Graph-Informed Adaptive Joint Optimization module boosts localization performance and reduce latency, utilizing cross-modal \textit{spatial-complementarity}.
% Extensive evaluations conducted on various scenarios show superior performance of mmE-Loc.

% In this paper, we present the design and implementation of mmE-Loc: a low latency-oriented system to enhance event cameras in 3D object localization using mmWave radar, which supports accurate and low-latency landing drone localization.
% mmE-Loc effectively extracts \textit{both consistent and complementary information} with two modules: $(i)$ a Consistency-Instructed Collaborative Tracking module and $(ii)$ a Graph-Informed Adaptive Joint Optimization module.
% These modules tightly couple event cameras and mmWave radar in early-stage filtering and later-stage fusion.
% Extensive evaluations demonstrate superior performance of mmE-Loc.
