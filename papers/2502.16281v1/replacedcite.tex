\section{Related Work}
% Over the past decade, numerous research on mining information from graphs have shifted from traditional representation learning approaches ____ to methods utilizing deep neural networks, including GNNs ____ and GCNs ____. Inspired by the Transformer ____, GAT ____ integrates the attention to aggregate node-level information in homogeneous networks, while HAN ____ introduces a two-level attention mechanism for node and semantic information in heterogeneous networks. MAGNN ____, MHGNN ____ and R-HGNN ____ proposed meta-path-based models to learn meta-path-based node embeddings. HetGNN ____ and MEGNN ____ take a meta-path-free approach to consider both structural and content information for each node jointly. HGT ____ incorporates information from high-order neighbors of different types through messages passing across ``soft'' meta-paths. MHGCN ____ captures local and global information by modeling the multiplex structures with depth and breadth behavior pattern aggregation. SeHGNN ____ simplifies structural information capture by precomputing neighbor aggregation and incorporating a transformer-based semantic fusion module. HAGNN ____ integrates meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation to generate the final embeddings. While existing methods have partially addressed heterogeneous graph embedding, none efficiently support embeddings based on user-specified ad-hoc meta-paths. FHGE fills this gap by enabling user-defined ad-hoc meta-paths to guide the embedding process in heterogeneous graphs.
