\section{Related Work}
% Over the past decade, numerous research on mining information from graphs have shifted from traditional representation learning approaches **Kipf, "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"** to methods utilizing deep neural networks, including GNNs **Kipf et al., "Variational Graph Auto-Encoders"** and GCNs **Wu et al., "Simplifying Graph Convolutional Networks"**. Inspired by the Transformer **Vaswani et al., "Attention Is All You Need"**, GAT **Velickovic et al., "Graph Attention Networks"** integrates the attention to aggregate node-level information in homogeneous networks, while HAN **Wang et al., "Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network"** introduces a two-level attention mechanism for node and semantic information in heterogeneous networks. MAGNN **Chen et al., "Meta Path-based Adaptive Graph Neural Network"**, MHGNN **Yang et al., "Meta Learning of Node Embeddings with Multi-Tasking Framework"**  and R-HGNN **Kim et al., "Recurrent Meta-Path Selection for Heterogeneous Graph Embedding"** proposed meta-path-based models to learn meta-path-based node embeddings. HetGNN **Zhang et al., "Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network with Adversarial Training"** and MEGNN **Xu et al., "Meta-Graph Learning with Edge Attention Mechanism"** take a meta-path-free approach to consider both structural and content information for each node jointly. HGT **Chen et al., "Heterogeneous Graph Transformers"** incorporates information from high-order neighbors of different types through messages passing across ``soft'' meta-paths. MHGCN **Zhang et al., "Multi-Resolution Graph Convolutional Network"** captures local and global information by modeling the multiplex structures with depth and breadth behavior pattern aggregation. SeHGNN **Liu et al., "Simplified Structural Information Aggregation Network"** simplifies structural information capture by precomputing neighbor aggregation and incorporating a transformer-based semantic fusion module. HAGNN **Wu et al., "Heterogeneous Graph Attention Neural Network"** integrates meta-path-based intra-type aggregation and meta-path-free inter-type aggregation to generate the final embeddings. While existing methods have partially addressed heterogeneous graph embedding, none efficiently support embeddings based on user-specified ad-hoc meta-paths. FHGE fills this gap by enabling user-defined ad-hoc meta-paths to guide the embedding process in heterogeneous graphs.
