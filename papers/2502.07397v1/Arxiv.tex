\title{Bandit Optimal Transport}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}%
    Despite the impressive progress in statistical Optimal Transport (OT) in recent years, there has been little interest in the study of the \emph{sequential learning} of OT. Surprisingly so, as this problem is both practically motivated and a challenging extension of existing settings such as linear bandits. This article considers (for the first time) the stochastic bandit problem of learning to solve generic Kantorovich and entropic OT problems from repeated interactions when the marginals are known but the cost is unknown. We provide $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret algorithms for both problems by extending linear bandits on Hilbert spaces. These results provide a reduction to infinite-dimensional linear bandits. To deal with the dimension, we provide a method to exploit the intrinsic regularity of the cost to learn, yielding corresponding regret bounds which interpolate between $\tilde{\mathcal O}(\sqrt{T})$ and $\tilde{\mathcal O}(T)$.
