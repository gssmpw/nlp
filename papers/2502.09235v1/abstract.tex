    My research deals with the foundations and applications of hybrid ASP.
    %
    While standard solvers like clingo have become very performant,
    challenges remain in regard to problems involving large numeric domains and calculations over them.
    %
    While various hybrid ASP solvers have been introduced and successfully applied over the last couple of years,
    there are many open questions regarding their theoretical foundations.
    %
    This is needed not only to improve future implementations
    but also to gain a deeper understanding of the essence of the problems they are applied to
    in order to find more natural ASP representations.
    %
    A central application to my research is the field of (product) configuration
    where we have already found first preliminary results.
