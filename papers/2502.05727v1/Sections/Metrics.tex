The optimality error (gap) is given by the difference between the true optimal value and the output of the attacked NN, divided by the true optimal value. We measure this gap for every output point and compute the average, and this is what we label as "Error of Opt Value" in Fig. \ref{fig:all_methods} and as the ``Optimality Gap" in Table \ref{tab1}. 
%
The feasibility error is given by the smallest distance between the output points and the feasible region. We find this for every output point and compute the average, and this is what we label as ``Feasibility of Opt Value" in Fig. \ref{fig:all_methods} and the ``Feasibility Gap" in Table \ref{tab1}.
