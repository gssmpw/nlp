The OPF problem, as outlined in \eqref{min}-\eqref{LC}, is typically resolved every 15 minutes to accommodate updated load demands ($P_D$). Traditionally handled using iterative solvers, this repeated process can alternatively be managed using ML-based optimization proxies. These proxies leverage historical data to develop a mapping between demand and the optimal generation profile, enabling faster, real-time decision-making.

Most existing OPF optimization proxies, including those we examine in this paper, utilize MATPOWER data that is transferred from MATLAB to Python for training. This data transfer introduces a potential vulnerability, as it could be targeted by data corruption attacks. In the following section, we discuss how data poisoning attacks are implemented against three distinct types of optimization proxies.
