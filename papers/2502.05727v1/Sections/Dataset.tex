In order to compare the impact of the poisoning attack across methods, we used the same number of data points for all three methods, which was 200 samples of the IEEE 200 bus case generated from MATPOWER \cite{matpow2011}, as it is the way most of these methods generated their data. The input data consists of the real demand power, as it is for a DC problem.
