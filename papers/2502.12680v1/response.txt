\subsection{Introduction}
Several studies were conducted to determine the requirements for remote control interfaces for AVs, for example, the HAVOC Project\footnote{\url{http://tinyurl.com/havocproject}; Accessed by: 29.11.2024}. 15 participants monitored 10 automated trucks and had to assist in five occurring events actively. Two of those events were active control tasks conducted with a steering wheel, pedals, and a computer screen. The feedback focused on the lack of information to consciously control the vehicle, including the need for a 360Â° overview of the surroundings and the uncertainty of when the AV can take over again, which we aimed to resolve in our prototype. To achieve this within the interface, we included a projected birds-eye view of the vehicle, added information on collision avoidance detection, and notified the RO when the vehicle took over again.

Comparably, \citet{Kang2020} studied remote driving.  Although remote driving has different interface requirements than remote assistance, some overlap exists. The requirements we identified and adapted for our use case concerning remote assistance included emphasizing the takeover reason, giving contextual road information, and giving AI suggestions for operations\@. We included automated suggestions only in \pathPlanning for differentiation. However, we kept automated suggestions reserved for \pathPlanning as this already embodies a selection from given suggestions and otherwise would break the fair comparison of the pure interaction concepts.

Kettwich et al.\@ (\citeyear{kettwich_teleoperation_2021}) used a demonstrational VR remote driving setup, whose interface was based on the requirements of \citet{Kang2017}. To gather these requirements, \citet{Kang2017} conducted 18 interviews. Half of them had some remote controlling experiences. %, although not necessarily with vehicles. 
80 requirements were collected. In a second interview with participants from industry, these requirements were clustered and rated, resulting in a final set of 20 requirements (e.g., 360-degree remote view, vehicle position, vehicle issues, traffic rules), where we adopted the relevant ones. % While these requirements were collected for a remote driving background, not all may apply to remote assistance, especially regarding the necessity rate. Nevertheless, we identified and adapted the relevant requirements for our interface, such as a 360-degree (top-down) view from the vehicle, information concerning the reason for the takeover, projected control actions, and vehicle speed.

\subsection{Limitations of Remote Controlling}
While controlling AVs remotely brings many advantages, limitations also exist. \citet{Kang2018} and \citet{kang_augmenting_2018} raise critical issues addressing the remote driving of AVs. Delays concerning the technical side of communication and the human side of reorientation and reaction time narrow the applicability of remote operations. Therefore, \citet{Kang2018} point out that requiring an RO to take over the vehicle at high speeds in a short time frame in the range of seconds would be unsafe. Taking these limitations into account, the expected safe situations that remain open for a takeover are those in which the vehicle is traveling at slow speeds, less than 10 mph\@, or has already pulled to the shoulder by performing a DDT as specified by the SAE\@ in a critical situation.

The technical delay in communication was further elaborated by \citet{kang_augmenting_2018}. They present a case study further investigating the imposed delay by comparing the effect of different levels of resolutions in LTE\@ and Wi-Fi\@, which represent "wireless networks used by vehicles"\@~\cite[p. 22]{kang_augmenting_2018}.

Concerning the given limitations on remote driving operations, we propose that the effects of limitations on remote assistance are less intensive and, therefore, bearable. As the task of speed and brake control is delegated to the vehicle, many involved security issues caused by latency and human factors (see  Section~\ref{sec:human_factors}) are minimized or entirely mitigated. Additionally, enabling the RO to plan vehicle routes for limited distances within remote assistance also enables them to assist multiple vehicles simultaneously, contrary to basic remote driving.
Therefore, our study focuses on remote assistance to take advantage of the benefits an SAE 4 vehicle presents to mitigate security risks.

\subsection{Conclusion}
In conclusion, our study aimed to investigate the usability and effectiveness of a human-machine interface for remote assistance of AVs in critical situations. The results show that participants were able to control the vehicle effectively, even at high speeds, and that the system was able to detect and respond to hazards on the road. The findings also highlight the importance of situational awareness and trust in the remote assistance system.
