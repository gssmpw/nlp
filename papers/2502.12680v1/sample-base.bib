	abstract     = {In today's encounters with vehicles, pedestrians are often dependent on cues in drivers' behavior such as eye contact, postures, and gestures. With an increased level of automation, and the transfer of control from the driver to the vehicle, the pedestrians cannot rely on such cues anymore. The question is: will there be new communication needs to warrant safe interactions with automated vehicles? This question is addressed by exploring pedestrians' willingness to cross the street and their emotional state in encounters with a seemingly automated vehicle. The results show that pedestrians' willingness to cross the street decrease with an inattentive driver. Eye contact with the driver on the other hand leads to calm interaction between vehicle and pedestrian. In conclusion, to sustain perceived safety when eye contact is discarded due to vehicle automation, it could be beneficial to provide pedestrians with the corresponding information in some other way (e.g., by means of an external vehicle interface).}

	abstract     = {The increasing number of autonomous vehicles has raised questions regarding pedestrian interaction with autonomous vehicles. Researchers have studied external interfaces designed for vehicle operators and other road-users (e.g., pedestrians). Most past studies have considered the interaction between pedestrians and autonomous vehicles with no visible operator. However, pedestrian-autonomous vehicle interaction may be complicated when there is a human sitting in the conventional driver's seat of an autonomous vehicle. Such a scenario may cause some pedestrians to look to the passenger for cues when they should be looking for cues from the vehicle. The objective of the current study was to investigate pedestrians' perspective of autonomous vehicles based on the interaction effect between passenger status and external features on the vehicle. Sixteen pedestrians completed a VR experiment. The results provided important insight into the important question of pedestrian-autonomous vehicle interaction when passengers are present in the driver seat of the vehicle.}

One challenge on this way is the detection and recognition of pedestrians and their intentions. While there are technological solutions to this problem, there seems to be no research on how to make this information transparent to the user in order to calibrate the user’s trust. Our work presents a comparative study of 5 visualization techniques with Augmented Reality or tablet-based visualization technology and two or three information clarity states of pedestrian intention in the context of highly automated driving. We investigated these in a user study in Virtual Reality (N=15). We found that such a visualization was rated reasonable, necessary, and that especially the Augmented Reality-based version with three clarity states was preferred.},

In part to reduce motor-vehicle related crashes, transportation researchers are pursuing the implementation of automated vehicles. Vehicle automation will eventually remove human control from the vehicle, but this may also remove interpersonal communication between pedestrians and human drivers. Therefore, many studies have investigated pedestrians' choice of features on autonomous vehicles (AVs) to facilitate communication of vehicle intention. The inclusion of child populations in these studies has been rare, however. This study investigated pedestrians' understandability of the external features on autonomous vehicles, considering different vehicle sizes and physics (speed and distance), and included both children and adults. The results revealed that children relied entirely on the communicating features of AVs to make their judgement on their safety, thereby adopted a higher risk strategy than their adult counterparts.}

	abstract     = {Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) are robotic devices with a propulsion system for navigation and an onboard computer for decision making. AUV research is gaining popularity because of its extensive applications in fields from military to science. Robotic systems are need of the hour for exploration and environmental safety of the vast and deep oceans and water bodies. This paper presents current research trends in the field of AUVs and highlights future research directions. Here localization and navigation techniques such as inertial navigation to simultaneous localization and mapping being used in current AUVs are discussed in detail. Different optimal path planning and control methods are highlighted. Use of different sensor technology like sonar, laser, acoustic modems and stereo vision systems for localization, navigation and mapping is presented. Recent developments in underwater wireless communication along with the commercially available devices are discussed.}

This is achieved through the study of all relevant interrelations among objects, phenomena and concepts by means of methods which are based on the utmost detachment from prejudice and carefully refrain from all prevaluations. Applications of the morphological methods of the total field coverage, of negation and construction, of the morphological box and others to technical problems in particular and to human problems in general are described. These not only illustrate how discovery, invention and research can be conducted most effectively but also how the morphological approach makes possible the clear recognition of those fatal aberrations of the human mind which must be overcome if we are ever to build a sound world.}

The taxonomy is intended to serve as a basis for concept development and further research on the effect of automated vehicles on human road users like pedestrians, cyclists and manual drivers. The taxonomy can be used to choose attributes and value facets which are relevant for a specific research question. This facilitates a systematic definition of traffic situations, which ensures that all relevant aspects are addressed when eliciting requirements or validating concepts. The overview of attributes also facilitates the identification of potential confounders. Another benefit is the enhanced comparability between different studies. The proposed taxonomy differs from previous taxonomies of traffic situations by focusing not only on the driver's but on the interaction partner's perspective, too.}

Especially when no prototype is feasible or available, VR constitutes an advantageous alternative since it allows tests in laboratory conditions with high flexibility and ensured safety for test participants. In the presented study, it is investigated how VR can be used as a tool for Usability Tests to evaluate Human Machine Interfaces (HMI) for communication between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians. Singapore with its regulations and requirements has been selected as reference. Beyond the findings that explicit HMI concepts improve the communication between autonomous vehicles and pedestrians, VR was validated as suitable tool to conduct Usability Tests. Further studies plan to integrate additional case studies as well as improved immersion of test participants within the virtual environment.}

	abstract     = {Objective:In this article, we investigated the effects of external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on pedestrians’ crossing intentions.Background:Literature suggests that the safety (i.e., not crossing when unsafe) and efficiency (i.e., crossing when safe) of pedestrians’ interactions with automated vehicles could increase if automated vehicles display their intention via an eHMI.Methods:Twenty-eight participants experienced an urban road environment from a pedestrian’s perspective using a head-mounted display. The behavior of approaching vehicles (yielding, nonyielding), vehicle size (small, medium, large), eHMI type (1. baseline without eHMI, 2. front brake lights, 3. Knightrider animation, 4. smiley, 5. text [WALK]), and eHMI timing (early, intermediate, late) were varied. For yielding vehicles, the eHMI changed from a nonyielding to a yielding state, and for nonyielding vehicles, the eHMI remained in its nonyielding state. Participants continuously indicated whether they felt safe to cross using a handheld button, and “feel-safe” percentages were calculated.Results:For yielding vehicles, the feel-safe percentages were higher for the front brake lights, Knightrider, smiley, and text, as compared with baseline. For nonyielding vehicles, the feel-safe percentages were equivalent regardless of the presence or type of eHMI, but larger vehicles yielded lower feel-safe percentages. The Text eHMI appeared to require no learning, contrary to the three other eHMIs.Conclusion:An eHMI increases the efficiency of pedestrian-AV interactions, and a textual display is regarded as the least ambiguous.Application:This research supports the development of automated vehicles that communicate with other road users.}

External human-machine interfaces (e-HMIs) may allow AVs and VRUs to communicate effectively. We investigated the effects of various light signals presented by a light bar placed on the test vehicle's roof (i.e. e-HMI). In addition, the driver was visible or the car appeared driverless by using a seat suit that covered the driver (Wizard-of-Oz design). A total of 173 random pedestrians passing by were interviewed. Participants felt significantly safer during the interaction with the vehicle when a driver was visible, while they evaluated the presented light signals as only partially trustworthy and unintuitive to understand. However, participants evaluated the application of light signals as e-HMIs for AVs as generally useful.}

This paper describes an empirical evaluation of a checklist that has been previously developed for the use in heuristic expert assessments, demonstrating that an ADS HMI that meets the guidelines as defined in the checklist scores higher in several measures of usability and acceptance than an HMI that does not meet the checklist requirements. Therefore, N{\thinspace}={\thinspace}57 participants completed two 15-min drives with an L3 ADS in a driving simulator. They experienced two variations of a L3 ADS HMI that differed in the degree of complying with the checklist. Inferential statistics showed that acceptance and usability measures differed substantially between the two experimental HMIs. Behavioral observations of interaction performance also demonstrate that non-compliance with the checklist items lowers the usability of the L3 system.}

The notion is used intuitively in the pertinent literature, but with surprisingly different meanings. We present a rigorous way of modelling the human and the machine in a shared-control system. This enables us to propose a precise definition of ``mode'' and ``mode confusion''. In our modelling approach, we extend the commonly used distinction between the machine and the user's mental model of it by explicitly separating these and their safety-relevant abstractions. Furthermore, we show that distinguishing three different interfaces during the design phase reduces the potential for mode confusion. A result is a new classification of mode confusions by cause, leading to a number of design recommendations for shared-control systems which help to avoid mode confusion problems. A further result is a foundation for detecting mode confusion problems by model checking.}

Basing on an infrared tracking system, infrared targets mounted at the users thumbs and index fingers are used to retrieve information about position and orientation of each finger. Our system receives this information and extracts static gestures by distance classifiers and dynamic gestures by statistical models. The concluded gesture is provided to any connected application. We introduce a small demonstration as basis for a short evaluation. In this we compare interaction in a real environment, Augmented Reality with a mouse/keyboard, and our gesture recognition system concerning properties, such as task execution time or intuitiveness of interaction. The results show that tasks executed by interaction with our gesture recognition system are faster than using the mouse/keyboard. However, this enhancement entails a slightly lowered wearing comfort.}

Unfortunately, their application is less than perfect and detailed information about preferred gesture execution regions, spatial extent, and time behavior are not available yet. Providing car (interior) manufacturer with gesture characteristics would allow them to design future in-vehicle concepts in a way to not interfere with gestural interaction. To tackle the problem, this research aims as preliminary work for a later standardization of the diverse properties of gestures and gesture classes similarly to what is already standardized in norms such as ISO 3958/4040 for placement and reachability of traditional controls and indicators. We have set up a real driving experiment recording trajectories and time behavior of gestures related to car and media control tasks. Data evaluation reveals that most of the subjects perform gestures in the same region (bounded by a "triangle" steering wheel, rear mirror, and gearshift) and with similar spatial extent (on average below 2 sec.). The generated density plots can be further used for an initial discussion about gesture execution in the passenger compartment. The final aim is to propose a new standard on permitted gesture properties (time, space) in the car.},

To investigate this question, we embedded a Synaptics StampPad in a computer game steering wheel and evaluated seven methods for selecting from a list of over 3000 street names. Selection speed was measured while stationary and while driving a simulator. Results show that the EdgeWrite gestural text entry method is about 20% to 50% faster than selection-based text entry or direct list-selection methods. They also show that methods with slower selection speeds generally resulted in faster driving speeds. However, with EdgeWrite, participants were able to maintain their speed and avoid incidents while selecting and driving at the same time. Although an obvious choice for constrained input, on-screen keyboards generally performed quite poorly.},

To investigate the kind of information about the car that pedestrians seek, and the places where do they look for it, we conducted an eye-tracking study with 26 participants and analyzed the fixation behavior when interacting with a manually-driven vehicle that approached while slowing and displaying a yielding behavior. Results show that a clear pattern of gaze behavior exists for pedestrians in looking at a vehicle during road-crossing situations as a function of the vehicle's distance. When the car is far away, pedestrians look at the environment or the road space ahead of the car. With the approach, the gaze gradually shifts to the windshield of the car. We conclude by discussing the implications of this insight in the user-centered-design of optimal external Human-Machine-Interfaces for automated vehicles.},

A controlled field experiment using a Wizard-of-Oz approach to simulate a driverless vehicle was conducted. 28 participants experienced a driverless and a human-operated vehicle from the perspective of a pedestrian. The vehicle was equipped with an external human machine interface (eHMI) that displayed the driving mode of the vehicle (driverless vs. human-operated). The results show that the crossing behavior, measured by critical gap acceptance, and the subjective reporting of perceived safety did not differ statistically significantly between the driverless and the human-operated driving condition.}

Subjective and objective measurements were collected. The results show that the defensive driving style was preferred and there were variations between participants related to their own driving style. The results indicate that the preferences of assertive drivers for the driving style of an autonomous vehicle may not match their own driving style. Yet, users of future autonomous vehicles should be able to indicate and adjust the driving behaviour of an autonomous vehicle to their own preferences in order to maximize comfort in travelling experience.},

However, the effectiveness of these sustainable product and service innovations is often limited by unexpected changes in consumption: some researchers thus hypothesize that the higher comfort and improved quality of time in driverless cars could lead to an increase in demand for driving with autonomous vehicles. So far, there is a lack of empirical evidence supporting either one or other of these hypotheses. To analyze the influence of autonomous driving on mobility behavior and to uncover user preferences, which serve as indicators for future travel mode choices, we conducted an online survey with a paired comparison of current and future travel modes with 302 participants in Germany. The results do not confirm the hypothesis that ownership will become an outdated model in the future. Instead they suggest that private cars, whether conventional or fully automated, will remain the preferred travel mode. At the same time, carsharing will benefit from full automation more than private cars. However, the findings indicate that the growth of carsharing will mainly be at the expense of public transport, showing that more emphasis should be placed in making public transport more attractive if sustainable mobility is to be developed.}

In a study, feedback was collected from users how they perceived such an action while driving in a simulator.

Furthermore, the paper aims to explore if complex communication needs can be signaled to pedestrians through motion behavior of the vehicle.In order to learn how other road users feel surrounded by self-driving cars, participants were confronted with different drivability of a self-programmed vehicle during our evaluation. As the results show, the vehicle's motion behavior is able to evoke certain emotions, which in turn lead to rational decisions within the participants.

In this process, information on system capabilities and limitations plays a crucial role.Method:In two simulator experiments, trust was repeatedly measured during an automated drive. In Study 1, all participants in a two-group experiment experienced a system-initiated take-over, and the occurrence of a system malfunction was manipulated. In Study 2 in a 2 × 2 between-subject design, system transparency was manipulated as an additional factor.Results:Trust was found to increase during the first interactions progressively. In Study 1, take-overs led to a temporary decrease in trust, as did malfunctions in both studies. Interestingly, trust was reestablished in the course of interaction for take-overs and malfunctions. In Study 2, the high transparency condition did not show a temporary decline in trust after a malfunction.Conclusion:Trust is calibrated along provided information prior to and during the initial drive with an automated vehicle. The experience of take-overs and malfunctions leads to a temporary decline in trust that was recovered in the course of error-free interaction. The temporary decrease can be prevented by providing transparent information prior to system interaction.Application:Transparency, also about potential limitations of the system, plays an important role in this process and should be considered in the design of tutorials and human-machine interaction (HMI) concepts of automated vehicles.}

	abstract     = {Road traffic is a social situation where participants heavily interact with each other. Consequently, communication plays an important role. Typically, the communication between pedestrians and drivers is nonverbal and consists of a combination of gestures, eye contact, and body movement. However, when vehicles become automated, this will change. Previous work has investigated the design and effectiveness of additional communication cues between pedestrians and automated vehicles. It remains unclear, though, how this impacts the perceptions of the quality of communication and impressions of mindfulness and prosociality. In this paper, we report an online experiment, where we evaluated the perception of communication cues in the form of on-road light projections, across different traffic scenarios and roles. Our results indicate that, while the cues can improve communication, their effect is dependent on traffic scenarios. These results provide preliminary implications for the design of communication cues that consider their prosocial aspects.},

To realize these benefits, AVs have to communicate with VRUs like pedestrians. While there are proposed solutions concerning the visualization or modality of external human-machine interfaces, a research gap exists regarding the AVs’ communication strategy when interacting with pedestrians. Our work presents a comparative study of an autonomous delivery vehicle with three communication strategies ranging from polite to dominant in two scenarios, at a crosswalk or on the street. We investigated these strategies in an online-based video study in a German (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;34) and a Chinese sample (N&nbsp;=&nbsp;56) regarding compliance, acceptance and trust. We found that a polite strategy led to more compliance in the Chinese but not the German sample. However, the polite strategy positively affected trust and acceptance of the AV in both samples equally.},

We used hierarchical statistical mediation analysis to trace differences in people's mental model of robots from these choices. In an experiment, a humanoid robot gave participants online advice about their health. We used mediation analysis to identify the causal path from the robot's voice and head dimensions to the participants' mental model, and to their willingness to follow the robot's advice. The male robot voice predicted impressions of a knowledgeable robot, whose advice participants said they would follow. Increasing the voice's fundamental frequency reduced this effect. The robot's short chin length (but not its forehead dimensions) predicted impressions of a sociable robot, which also predicted intentions to take the robot's advice. We discuss the use of this approach for designing robots for different roles, when people's mental model of the robot matters.},

Hence, new HCI designs need to fill this gap. This work presents the implementation and comparison of different interaction concepts in virtual reality (VR). They were derived after an analysis of 28 works from research and industry, which were classified into five groups according to their complexity and the type of communication. We implemented one concept per group for a within-subject experiment in VR. For each concept, we varied if the AV is going to stop and how early it starts to activate its display. We observed effects on safety, trust, and user experience. A good concept displays information on the street, uses unambiguous signals (e.g., green lights) and has high visibility. Additional feedback, such as continuously showing the recognized pedestrian's location, seem to be unnecessary and may irritate.},

abstract = { Trust is important in determining how drivers interact with automated vehicles. Overtrust has contributed to fatal accidents; and distrust can hinder successful adoption of this technology. However, existing studies on trust are often hard to compare, given the complexity of the construct and the absence of standardized measures. Further, existing trust scales often do not consider its multi-dimensionality. Another challenge is that driving is strongly context- and situation-dependent. We present the Situational Trust Scale for Automated Driving, a short questionnaire to assess different aspects of situational trust, based on the trust model proposed by Hoff and Bashir. We evaluated the scale using an online study in the US and Germany (N=303), where participants faced different videos of an automated vehicle. Results confirm the existence of situational factors as components of trust, and support the scale being a valid measure of situational trust in this automated driving context.},

abstract = {Using a smartphone while walking in urban traffic is dangerous. Pedestrians might become distracted and have to split their attention between traffic, walking and using the mobile device. The increasing level of automation in vehicles introduces novel challenges and opportunities for pedestrian-vehicle interaction, e.g external displays attached to automated vehicles. However, these approaches are hardly scalable and fail to provide clear information in a multi-user environment. We investigate whether a smartphone app could provide individual guidance to enhance pedestrian safety in future traffic. To this end, we tested three app concepts in a user study (N=24) and found that on-screen guidance increases the frequency of successful crossing decisions significantly. In addition, all participants indicated that they would use the proposed system, preferably with an unobtrusive colored bar indicating the safest crossing decision in real-time. Integrating smartphones into the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians could increase situational awareness while crossing roads, solve the scalability problem and thus foster pedestrian safety in future traffic scenarios.},

abstract = { Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are an emerging theme for future transportation. However, research on pedestrian-AV interaction, which promotes pedestrian safety during autonomous driving, is not a well-explored domain. One challenge preventing the development of pedestrian-AV interaction research is that there is no publicly available and standardized benchmark to allow researchers to investigate how different interfaces could help pedestrians communicate with AVs. To resolve this challenge, we introduce the Virtual Reality Pedestrian-Autonomous Vehicle Interaction Benchmark (VR-PAVIB). VR-PAVIB is a standardized platform that can be used to reproduce interaction scenarios and compare results. Our benchmark provides state-of-the-art functionalities that can easily be implemented in any interaction scenario authored by a user. The VR-PAVIB can easily be used in a controlled lab space using low-cost virtual reality equipment. We have released our project code and include the automotive user interface community to extend VR-PAVIB.},

abstract = { Effect sizes are underappreciated and often misinterpreted—the most common mistakes being to describe them in ways that are uninformative (e.g., using arbitrary standards) or misleading (e.g., squaring effect-size rs). We propose that effect sizes can be usefully evaluated by comparing them with well-understood benchmarks or by considering them in terms of concrete consequences. In that light, we conclude that when reliably estimated (a critical consideration), an effect-size r of .05 indicates an effect that is very small for the explanation of single events but potentially consequential in the not-very-long run, an effect-size r of .10 indicates an effect that is still small at the level of single events but potentially more ultimately consequential, an effect-size r of .20 indicates a medium effect that is of some explanatory and practical use even in the short run and therefore even more important, and an effect-size r of .30 indicates a large effect that is potentially powerful in both the short and the long run. A very large effect size (r = .40 or greater) in the context of psychological research is likely to be a gross overestimate that will rarely be found in a large sample or in a replication. Our goal is to help advance the treatment of effect sizes so that rather than being numbers that are ignored, reported without interpretation, or interpreted superficially or incorrectly, they become aspects of research reports that can better inform the application and theoretical development of psychological research. }

abstract = { Recent automotive research often focuses on automated driving, including the interaction between automated vehicles (AVs) and so-called “vulnerable road users” (VRUs). While road safety statistics and traffic psychology at least define VRUs as pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists, many publications on human-vehicle interaction use the term without even defining it. The actual target group remains unclear. Since each group already poses a broad spectrum of research challenges, a one-fits-all solution seems unrealistic and inappropriate, and a much clearer differentiation is required. To foster clarity and comprehensibility, we propose a literature-based taxonomy providing a structured separation of (vulnerable) road users, designed to particularly (but not exclusively) support research on the communication between VRUs and AVs. It consists of two conceptual hierarchies and will help practitioners and researchers by providing a uniform and comparable set of terms needed for the design, implementation, and description of HCI applications.},

We present an interview study of 20 individuals to determine how assistive technology use is affected by social and professional contexts and interactions. We found that specific assistive devices sometimes marked their users as having disabilities; that functional access took priority over feeling self-conscious when using assistive technologies; and that two misperceptions pervaded assistive technology use: (1) that assistive devices could functionally eliminate a disability, and (2) that people with disabilities would be helpless without their devices. Our findings provide further evidence that accessibility should be built into mainstream technologies. When this is not feasible, assistive devices should incorporate cutting edge technologies and strive to be designed for social acceptability, a new design approach we propose here.},

Specifically, we explore how abilities become negotiated through video ethnography with six VI athletes and spectators during the Rio 2016 Paralympics. We use generated in-depth examples to identify how technology can be a meaningful part of ability negotiations, emphasizing how these embed into the social interactions and lives of people with VI. In contrast to treating technology as a solution to a 'sensory deficit', we understand it to support the triangulation process of sense-making through provision of appropriate additional information. Further, we suggest that technology should not try and replace human assistance, but instead enable people with VI to better identify and interact with other people in-situ.},

However, simply creating accessible technologies does not guarantee that these will be available or adopted. Because much work occurs within shared workspaces, decisions about assistive technology use may be mediated by social interactions with, and expectations of, sighted coworkers. We present findings from a qualitative field study of five workplaces from the perspective of blind employees. Although all participants were effective employees, they expressed that working in a predominantly sighted office environment produces impediments to a blind person's independence and to their integration as an equal coworker. We describe strategies employed by our participants to create and maintain an accessible workplace and present suggestions for future technology that better supports blind workers as equal peers in the workplace.},

abstract = {Highly automated vehicles, occasionally require users to resume vehicle control from non-driving related tasks by issuing cues called take-over request (TOR). Due to being engaged in non-driving related tasks (NDRT), users have a decreased level of situational awareness of the driving context. Therefore, user interface designs for TORs should ensure smooth transitions from the NDRTs to vehicle control. In this paper, we investigated the role of decision priming cues as TORs across different levels of NDRT engagement. In a driving simulator, users performed a reading span task while driving in automated mode. They received audio-visual TORs which primed them with an appropriate maneuver (steering vs. braking), depending on the traffic situation. Our results showed that priming users with upcoming maneuvers results in faster responses and longer time to collision to obstacles. However, the level of engagement in NDRT does not affect user responses to TORs.},

However, their potential has not been fully investigated to make use in international standards. To contribute to making authentic standards, the present paper investigated the effects of various non-speech displays to further refine auditory variables. Twenty-four young drivers drove in the driving simulator that had both handover and takeover transitions between manual and automated modes with a secondary task. The reaction times for handover and takeover and other sound user experience questionnaire results are reported with discussions and future work.},

 abstract = {This paper provides a taxonomy of different forms of autonomous vehicle handover situations. It covers scheduled, emergency and non-emergency handovers and it differentiates between system and driver initiated handovers. The purpose is to examine how the system and driver are responsible for different stages in the transition timeline, i.e., first alert, handover phase, and return to automated control (handback). This is examined from the perspective of SAE levels in comparison to aspects drawn from situational awareness. The work is complemented by analysis drawn from current practice within the insurance industry and interviews with insurers. The result is a closer examination of system and driver responsibility which is independent of but includes SAE levels with respect to specific handover situations. It also identifies gaps between the current legal liability for accidents when compared to aspects such as the situational awareness requirements placed on driver under different driving conditions.},

will be common. Questions surrounding how vulnerable road users such as pedestrians
in wheelchairs (PWs) will make crossing decisions in these new situations are underexplored.
We conducted a remote co-design study with one of the researchers of this work who
has the lived experience as a powered wheelchair user and applied inclusive design
practices. This allowed us to identify and reflect on interface design ideas that
can help PWs make safe crossing decisions at intersections. Through an iterative five-week
study, we implemented interfaces that can be placed on the vehicle, on the wheelchair,
and on the street infrastructure and evaluated them during the co-design sessions
using a VR simulator testbed. Informed by our findings, we discuss design insights
for implementing inclusive interfaces to improve interactions between autonomous vehicles

abstract = {In this paper, we report user preferences regarding color and animation patterns to
support the interaction between Automated Vehicles (AVs) and pedestrians through an
external Human-Machine-Interface (eHMI). Existing concepts of eHMI differ -- among
other things -- in their use of colors or animations to express an AV's yielding intention.
In the absence of empirical research, there is a knowledge gap regarding which color
and animation leads to highest usability and preferences in traffic negotiation situations.
We conducted an online survey (N=400) to investigate the comprehensibility of a light
band eHMI with a combination of 5 color and 3 animation patterns for a yielding AV.
Results show that cyan is considered a neutral color for communicating a yielding
intention. Additionally, a uniformly flashing or pulsing animation is preferred compared
to any pattern that animates sideways. These insights can contribute in the future
design and standardization of eHMIs.},

to identify the causal path from the robot's voice and head dimensions to the participants'

voice predicted impressions of a knowledgeable robot, whose advice participants said
they would follow. Increasing the voice's fundamental frequency reduced this effect.
The robot's short chin length (but not its forehead dimensions) predicted impressions
of a sociable robot, which also predicted intentions to take the robot's advice. We
discuss the use of this approach for designing robots for different roles, when people's
mental model of the robot matters.},

However, despite their growing use, there is still noticeable skepticism in society regarding these applications. Drawing an analogy from human social interaction, the concept of trust provides a valid foundation for describing the relationship between humans and automation. Accordingly, this paper explores how firms systematically foster trust regarding applied AI. Based on empirical analysis using nine case studies in the transportation and medical technology industries, our study illustrates the dichotomous constitution of trust in applied AI. Concretely, we emphasize the symbiosis of trust in the technology as well as in the innovating firm and its communication about the technology. In doing so, we provide tangible approaches to increase trust in the technology and illustrate the necessity of a democratic development process for applied AI.}

abstract = {In the near future, automated vehicles (AVs) will enter the urban transport system. This fact will lead to mixed traffic consisting of AVs, human car drivers and vulnerable road users. Since the AV’s passenger no longer has to monitor the driving scene, conventional communication does not exist anymore, which is essential for traffic efficiency and safety. In research, there are plenty of studies focusing on how AVs could communicate with pedestrians. One approach is to use external human-machine interfaces (eHMIs) on the AV’s surface. In contrast to the studies dealing with AV-pedestrian communication, this paper focuses on communication strategies of AVs with drivers of regular vehicles in different road bottleneck scenarios. The eHMI development and design is building on previously defined requirements and on fundamentals of human visual perception. After designing several eHMI drafts, we conducted a user survey with 29 participants resulting in the final eHMI concept. The evaluation of the evolved eHMI was conducted in a driving simulator experiment with 43 participants investigating the AV-human driver interaction at road bottlenecks. The participants were assigned either to the experimental group being faced with the eHMI or to the baseline group without explicit communication. The results show significantly shorter passing times and fewer crashes among the human drivers in the group with the eHMI. Additionally, the paper researches the aftereffects of an automation failure, where the AV first yields the right of way and then changes its strategy and insisted on priority. Experiencing the automation failure is reflected in increased passing times, reduced acceptance ratings and a lower perceived usefulness. In conclusion, especially in unregulated bottleneck scenarios flawless communication via eHMIs increases traffic efficiency and safety.}

abstract="The absence of a human driver in an automated vehicle (AV) raises new challenges in communication and cooperation between road users, especially for ambiguous situations where road users would like to communicate their intention explicitly. This paper investigates the effect of a novel external human-machine interface (eHMI) which was designed to address this issue by signaling the AV's intention through a 360{\textdegree} LED light-band mounted outside of the AV. In a simulator study an eHMI interaction strategy was implemented that should convey the message ``I am giving way'' to a manually driven vehicle operated by participants waiting at a t-junction. The experimental study incorporated three t-junction scenarios where the AV had always the right of way but may yield to a driver waiting at the intersection. The intention of the AV was communicated either implicitly (braking) or implicitly and explicitly (braking and eHMI). It was analyzed whether participants would understand the AV's intention and accept the gap provided in front of the AV. Through participants' subjective ratings the understandability, the usability and the acceptance of the eHMI solution were evaluated. The results showed that the majority of participants (85{\%}) understood the meaning of the eHMI signal after two interactions. Initial gap acceptance results showed a positive effect of the eHMI solution. The presence of an eHMI improved participants perceived safety and trust. Subjective ratings for usability and acceptance indicated that participants perceived this eHMI interaction strategy as easy to use and were willing to communicate with an AV in this way. The results of the present study will be used to investigate the beneficial impact of this eHMI interaction strategy further in more complex traffic scenarios.",

missing face-to-face interaction between driver and other road users when in automated
mode (SAE L3+). The lack of confirmation from a driver-passenger of an automated vehicle
(AV) to have seen a manual vehicle and that its driver can therefore overtake, change
lane, or cut-in safely can lead to dangerous situations and severe accidents. In this
work, we propose the vehicle to take-over and support this communication demand. To
better understand communication needs and user requirements we developed different
concepts for external human-machine interface (eHMI) visualizations on the entire
car body and investigated their potential in a user study (N=24). Our results suggest
that novel concepts to take charge of the communication between AV and the driver
of a manual car have great potential, are clearly understood by subjects, and are
rated superior to the ordinary communication with headlight flashers only.},

the intention of AV to HD is an unsolved problem. In this study, we investigate the
usefulness of three HMI-based communication methods from the viewpoint of HDs, i.e.,
the internal HMI (iHMI) based on vehicle-to-vehicle communications on head-up display
in manually driven vehicle, the external HMI (eHMI) on AV, as well as using both of
them synchronously. Participants, as the HDs, experienced these three HMIs through
videos on the online-survey and performed subjective evaluations. We found that although
there were no significant differences in the subjective evaluation results of participants
for the three HMIs, iHMI gave better evaluations of understanding, safety, and stress,
while eHMI had the lowest evaluation of trust.},

This work presents SwiVR-Car-Seat, a low-cost swivel seat to simulate vehicle motion using rotation. In an exploratory user study (N=18), participants sat in a virtual autonomous vehicle and performed interaction tasks using the input modalities touch, gesture, gaze, or speech. Results show that the simulation increased the perceived realism of vehicle motion in virtual reality and the feeling of presence. Task performance was not influenced uniformly across modalities; gesture and gaze were negatively affected while there was little impact on touch and speech. The findings can advise automotive user interface design to mitigate the adverse effects of vehicle motion on the interaction.},

To drive in urban environment safely, autonomous vehicles need to become able to convey the information to other road users, such as pedestrians or driving drivers, and make them understand their action intent. Although theoretically self-driving cars will let other road users pass through the road firstly, for giving them psychological comfort and sense of safety during road use, certain audiovisual interactions between autonomous car and other road users are helpful and essential. In the current development of autonomous vehicles, there are a lot of Automotive external interactive interfaces designs to show their intention. In this paper, we explore driver's understanding of five interactive display places with three conceptual interactive modalities (text, smile, light strip) in a manual driving car crossing the no traffic signal street situation by video study. Based on different situations and scenes, we compared the error rate of drivers in different display places and modalities, as well as the perception and understanding of drivers on display places and modalities, and we found that door surface is the best place in these places to convey the autonomous car's purpose to the manual driving car's driver.",

To explore this conflict, we conducted an online experiment (N=59) with different message types (no message, intention, command), gestures (no gesture, wave, stop), and user positions (driver, co-driver) and measured the pedestrian’s confidence in crossing. Our results show that certain combinations (e.g., car indicates cross while the user in the driver seat gestures stop) confused the pedestrian, resulting in significantly lower confidence to cross. We further show that designing intention-based external communication led to less confusion and a significantly higher intention to cross.}

To evaluate potential solutions to this problem, we conducted an online video-based within-subjects experiment (N = 59). The solutions under evaluation were mode distinction, vehicle appearance, and the visibility of the passenger via a tintable windshield. Our results show that especially the mode distinction and the conspicuous sensor attached to the automated vehicle showed positive effects. A tintable windshield, however, was negatively assessed. Thus, our work helps to design eHMI concepts to introduce automated vehicles safely by informing about feasible methods to avoid mode confusion.}

abstract = {Pedestrians are very vulnerable road users. Autonomous vehicles driving on the street are expected to reduce the risks for pedestrians. However, traffic will include manually driven vehicles for the next decades; therefore, the risk remains and can even increase due to pedestrians’ overreliance on technology. Thus, we propose to use autonomous vehicles parked at the side of the road to continually survey its surroundings and to issue warnings to pedestrians in potentially risky situations. Findings of a Virtual Reality (N=20) study show that participants preferred the communication on the vehicle compared to a communication on the sidewalk, that the visualization grabbed participants’ attention, and that overall crossing time was not significantly affected. This concept highlights the potential autonomous vehicles could have in making traffic safer, even while being parked.},

abstract = {Autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to communicate to vulnerable road users as a substitution of, for example, driver-pedestrian communication, leading to increased safety and acceptance. This communication is currently one-directional, i.e., from the AV to the pedestrian. However, today’s communication between drivers and pedestrians in crossing scenarios is bidirectional. Pedestrians gesture “thank you’’ or wave drivers through in case they do not want to cross. Human drivers often acknowledge this, for example, with a nod. We present an experiment in Virtual Reality (N=20), in which the effect of such acknowledgment of the AVs via its external communication is investigated for the two described scenarios and concerning pedestrian presence. Results show that such feedback is perceived as highly necessary, depends on the scenario, and improves the perceived intelligence of the AV, confirming a Halo-Effect.},

The study revealed users' general acceptance of novel modalities (e.g., brain or thermal activity) and interaction with locations other than the front (e.g., seat or table).

abstract = {Platooning is an application where a group of vehicles move one after each other in close proximity, acting jointly as a single physical system. The scope of platooning is to improve safety, reduce fuel consumption, and increase road use efficiency. Even if conceived several decades ago as a concept, based on the new progress in automation and vehicular networking platooning has attracted particular attention in the latest years and is expected to become of common implementation in the next future, at least for trucks. The platoon system is the result of a combination of multiple disciplines, from transportation, to automation, to electronics, to telecommunications. In this survey, we consider the platooning, and more specifically the platooning of trucks, from the point of view of wireless communications. Wireless communications are indeed a key element, since they allow the information to propagate within the convoy with an almost negligible delay and really making all vehicles acting as one. Scope of this paper is to present a comprehensive survey on connected vehicles for the platooning application, starting with an overview of the projects that are driving the development of this technology, followed by a brief overview of the current and upcoming vehicular networking architecture and standards, by a review of the main open issues related to wireless communications applied to platooning, and a discussion of security threats and privacy concerns. The survey will conclude with a discussion of the main areas that we consider still open and that can drive future research directions.}

abstract = {To ensure road safety in mixed traffic, automated vehicles (AVs) must be equipped with distinct and easy-to-understand communication strategies. For this, the communication design of AVs might be oriented toward implicit communication between manually driven vehicles. This research focused on how drivers interpret observable vehicle behavior (vehicle trajectory) to predict vehicle intentions and planned maneuvers. In addition, the processing and interpretation of contradictory cues were examined as a possible cause for misunderstandings and failed coordination. Two video-based experiments investigated the presumed intention (yielding or insisting on priority), intention recognition time, distinctiveness, and cooperativeness of a vehicle’s implicit communication at narrow road passages. For this, two vehicles approached a bottleneck from opposite sides, and only one vehicle could pass at a time. The driving behavior of the oncoming vehicle consisted of longitudinal (decelerating, stopping, accelerating, maintaining speed) and lateral movements (driving to the center, driving to the edge of the road, no lateral deviation) at different timings (early, late). The results indicated advantages of lateral vehicle movements for distinct intention communication. Lateral movements were interpreted the fastest, perceived more distinct, and were more decisive for the presumed intention than longitudinal movements. Early communication was preferred by drivers but increased the intention recognition time, especially for longitudinal movements. However, early lateral communication was interpreted as fast as late longitudinal communication. Furthermore, lateral and longitudinal vehicle movements within a driving pattern that contradicted each other led to ambiguous perceptions. For AVs, early distinct communication via lateral vehicle movement is recommended. Minimizing ambiguity in the interpretation of communication cues might maximize the probability of the safest response from human drivers and contribute to accident prevention in mixed traffic.}

abstract = {Self-driving vehicles are able to drive on their own as long as the requirements of their autonomous systems are met. If the system reaches the boundary of its capabilities, the system has to de-escalate (e.g. emergency braking) or hand over control to the human driver. Accordingly, the design of a functional handover assistant requires that it enable drivers to both take over control and feel comfortable while doing so -- even when they were "out of the loop" with other tasks. We introduce a process to hand over control from a full self-driving system to manual driving, and propose a number of handover implementation strategies. Moreover, we designed and implemented a handover assistant based on users' preferences and conducted a user study with 30 participants, whose distraction was ensured by a realistic distractor task. Our evaluation shows that car-driver handovers prompted by multimodal (auditory and visual) warnings are a promising strategy to compensate for system boundaries of autonomous vehicles. The insights we gained from the take-over behavior of drivers led us to formulate recommendations for more realistic evaluation settings and the design of future handover assistants.},

In such scenarios, the user becomes the driver and has to quickly gain situational awareness. With advanced sensory, an automated vehicle could aid the user in building situational awareness by providing information. A literature analysis found no commonly conveyed information. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of four different abstraction levels (high, medium-high, medium, and low) and used modalities (visual vs. visual+auditory) on situational awareness and accompanying usability scores, we evaluated eight systems and a baseline without information display. In the between-subjects online monitor-based study (N=225), we found that while subjective measures are higher and a warning is required, providing abstract information does not improve objective situational awareness, and only being provided with visual information was preferred.},

This work comprehensively consolidates studies in the rapidly emerging field of SAV. The primary focus is the comprehensive review of the foreseen impacts, which are categorised into seven groups, namely (i) Traffic & Safety, (ii) Travel behaviour, (iii) Economy, (iv) Transport supply, (v) Land–use, (vi) Environment & (vii) Governance. Pertinently, an SAV typology is presented and the components involved in modelling SAV services are described. Issues relating to the expected demand patterns and a required suitable policy framework are explicitly discussed.}

abstract = {Nonparametric data from multi-factor experiments arise often in human-computer interaction (HCI). Examples may include error counts, Likert responses, and preference tallies. But because multiple factors are involved, common nonparametric tests (e.g., Friedman) are inadequate, as they are unable to examine interaction effects. While some statistical techniques exist to handle such data, these techniques are not widely available and are complex. To address these concerns, we present the Aligned Rank Transform (ART) for nonparametric factorial data analysis in HCI. The ART relies on a preprocessing step that "aligns" data before applying averaged ranks, after which point common ANOVA procedures can be used, making the ART accessible to anyone familiar with the F-test. Unlike most articles on the ART, which only address two factors, we generalize the ART to N factors. We also provide ARTool and ARTweb, desktop and Web-based programs for aligning and ranking data. Our re-examination of some published HCI results exhibits advantages of the ART.},

abstract = {Automated vehicles (AVs) may have broad uses in society, but some applications may be more acceptable than others. Determining contexts in which AVs can acceptably operate is a substantial challenge for policy makers. In an online YouGov survey (N = 1175) with text-and-image vignettes of a one- or three-lane road section, AV convoys that shared lanes with a normal vehicle were perceived less positively and led to greater blame toward their owning institutions than lone AVs. AVs affiliated with a private commercial company were perceived less positively than those affiliated with a public transit agency. AVs used to regulate traffic of the vehicles behind them were blamed more than AVs used to navigate through traffic to reach a destination. These results suggest that numerical balance, vehicle affiliation and intended purpose are aspects of future AV policies for mixed traffic in shared lanes that will influence people's impressions of automated vehicles on public roads.}

Typically, a remote human operator provides instructions, permission or waypoints to the vehicle, or remotely drive it. However, the purpose and tasks of the operator are very diverse for different modes and environments: ports and yards, (on-demand) taxi services and low-speed passenger shuttles, long-haul commercial trucks, road-based last-mile/middle-mile delivery vehicles, sidewalk delivery robots, privately owned vehicles, autonomous vessels and air mobility, on confined areas, segregated and shared infrastructure. Moreover, there is an intuitive synergy with road traffic management and fleet management services, and eventually multi-domain integrated operations management centers. This chapter aims to increase awareness and understanding of remote support by sharing experiences and achievements alongside discussion of technological requirements, operational aspects and future research needs.},

However, it is clear that at least in the near and foreseeable future, AVs will not be able to resolve all road incidents and that in some situations remote human assistance will be required. However, remote driving is not trivial and introduces many challenges stemming mostly from the physical disconnect of the remote operator. In order to highlight these challenges and understand how to better design AV teleoperation interfaces, we conducted several observations of AV teleoperation sessions as well as in-depth interviews with 14 experts. Based on these interviews, we provide an investigation and analysis of the major AV teleoperation challenges. We follow this by providing design suggestions for the development of future teleoperation interfaces for assistance and driving of AVs.},

	abstract = {The idea of remote controlling ships for operational and commercial uses has developed beyond concepts. Controlling and monitoring vessels from a distant location requires updating the concept and requirements of shore control centers (SCCs), where human operators control the fleet via cameras, GPS, and many other types of sensors. While remote ship operation promises to reduce operational and maintenance costs, while increasing loading capacity and safety, it also brings significant uncertainty related to both the human-machine and human-human interactions which will affect operations. Achieving safe, reliable, and efficient remote ship operations requires consideration of both technological, cultural, social and human factor aspects of the system. Indeed, operators will act as captain and crew remotely, from the SCC, introducing new types of hardware and software interactions. This paper provides an overview of human factor issues that may affect human-machine and human-human interactions in the course of remote ship operations. In doing so, the literature related to remote operations in the domains of shipping, aerial vehicles, cranes, train transportation, automobiles, and mining is reviewed. Findings revealed that human factor issues are likely to fall into 13 distinct groups based on the type of human interactions that take place in SCCs.},

	abstract = {This work presents a novel remote control solution for an Autonomous Vehicle (AV), where the system structure is split into two sides. Both sides are assumed to be synchronized and linked through a communication network, which introduces time-varying delays and packet disorder. An Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to cope with the non-linearities that appear in the global model of the AV. The EKF fuses the data provided by the sensing devices of the AV in order to estimate the AV state, reducing the noise effect. Additionally, the EKF includes an h-step-ahead state prediction stage, which, together with the consideration of a packet-based control strategy, enables facing the network-induced delays. Since the AV position is provided by a camera, which is a slow sensing device, a dual-rate controller is required to achieve certain desired (nominal) dynamic control performance. The use of a dual-rate control framework additionally enables saving network bandwidth and deals with packet disorder. As the path-tracking control algorithm, pure pursuit is used. Application results show that, despite existing communication problems and slow-rate measurements, the AV is able to track the desired path, keeping the nominal control performance.},

	title = {Roles in the {Teleoperation} of {Highly} {Automated} {Vehicles} in {Public} {Transport}},
	abstract = {Teleoperation is a promising approach to boost the introduction of highly automated driving. It transfers exceptionally challenging driving tasks from the vehicle’s automation to a human operator who remote-controls the automated vehicle (AV). Particularly in public transport, teleoperated driving could contribute significantly to flexible mobility solutions such as on-demand shuttle services on the “last mile” between a major hub of transport, e.g., a train station, and the final destination (Hamburger Hochbahn, 2021; RealLab Hamburg, 2020). In order to link teleoperated AVs with other means of transport and coordinate subtasks of teleoperated driving, facilities with distinct roles and responsibilities regarding the teleoperation of AVs, so-called Remote Operation Centers (ROCs), may facilitate safe and efficient AV operations embedded in public transport. Their structure und roles entailed are described in this paper. The ROCs will be responsible both for monitoring AV operations in a specified area overall and intervening in case of disturbances. Their architecture is based on the assumption that vehicles will be widely automated (SAE level 4 (Society of Automotive Engineers, 2021)), i.e., they will be operational under a plethora of Operational Design Domains (ODDs), covering most use cases. Interventions by the operator are therefore not critical for ensuring safety, as the automation will be able to conduct minimum risk maneuvers and bring itself to a safe halt without posing a threat to surrounding traffic. Rather than that, human operators will be able to extend the range of available ODDs. Thus, human intervention is optional but increases operational efficiency and passenger satisfaction. A ROC will be comprised of the following central roles: a central manager and overseer of operations, the Remote Coordinator (RC), several operators who execute direct driving tasks, the Remote Driving Operators (RDOs), and one or more Remote System Operators (RSOs) that maintain the backend of remote-operation, and a couple of peripheral roles. Each role entails a certain set of requirements, tasks and responsibilities and requires a distinct human-machine interaction (HMI) concept for a workstation.},

A review of the literature shows that there are almost as many methods of assessment of acceptance as there are acceptance studies. The tool for studying acceptance of new technological equipment that is presented here has a major advantage compared with many other studies in that esoteric knowledge of scaling techniques is not required. The technique is simple and consists of nine 5-point rating-scale items. These items load on two scales, a scale denoting the usefulness of the system, and a scale designating satisfaction. The technique has been applied in six different studies in different test environments and analyses performed over these studies show that it is a reliable instrument for the assessment of acceptance of new technology. The technique was sensitive to differences in opinion to specific aspects of in-vehicle systems, as well as to differences in opinion between driver groups. In a concluding section explicit recommendations for use of the scale are given.}

In such scenarios, the user becomes the driver and has to quickly gain situational awareness. With advanced sensory, an automated vehicle could aid the user in building situational awareness by providing information. A literature analysis found no commonly conveyed information. Therefore, to evaluate the effects of four different abstraction levels (high, medium-high, medium, and low) and used modalities (visual vs. visual+auditory) on situational awareness and accompanying usability scores, we evaluated eight systems and a baseline without information display. In the between-subjects online monitor-based study (N=225), we found that while subjective measures are higher and a warning is required, providing abstract information does not improve objective situational awareness, and only being provided with visual information was preferred.},

This shift in the human operator role to that of an observer and occasional teleoperator requires appropriate interaction interfaces. In this paper, we present an in-context analysis of previously proposed teleoperation information requirements realized as concrete user interfaces in a user study (N=16). Participants completed multiple tasks in a mixed approach, controlling an actual miniature vehicle via an XR enabled headset which showed two interface manifestations (minimum and maximum requirements realized). From the results, we derive separate sets of fundamental UI elements per requirement for effective teleoperation in two phases of interaction: orientation and navigation.

One open question is how to perform such tests to sufficiently prove the vehicle’s capabilities. Designing a proper testing platform is particularly important for multi-vehicle scenarios, because test setups with actual real vehicles are not scalable. This paper proposes a mixed-reality testing framework which seamlessly combines virtual and real testing. The authors conducted a mixed-reality experiment of an automated valet parking (AVP) scenario, where virtual vehicles interact with a real vehicle-in-the-loop system in a simulated world. The experiment was developed to evaluate the algorithmic design of a distributed control scheme for an AVP system. Comparing the mixed-reality results to those of a pure virtual simulation allowed the authors to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithmic design against certain disturbances, while also revealing which parts of the system were sufficiently or inadequately modeled during the development process.}

Beyond these technical issues, we argue that the security-by-design principle for smart and complex autonomous systems, such as an Autonomous Vehicle (AV) is poorly understood and rarely practiced. Unlike traditional IT systems, where the risk mitigation techniques and adversarial models are well studied and developed with security design principles such as security perimeter and defense-in-depth, the lack of such a framework for connected autonomous systems is plaguing the design and implementation of a secure AV. We attempt to identify the core issues of securing an AV. This is done methodically by developing a security-by-design framework for AV from the first principles. Subsequently, the technical challenges for AV security are identified.},

	abstract = {Self-driving or autonomous vehicle systems are being designed over the world with increasing success in recent years. In spite of many advances so far, it is unlikely that such systems are going to ever achieve perfect accuracy under all conditions. In particular, occasional failures are anticipated when such vehicles encounter situations not observed before, or conflicting information is available to the system from the environment. Under such infrequent failure scenarios, the research community has so far, considered two alternatives -- to return control to the driver in the vehicle, which has its own challenges and limitations, or to attempt to safely "park" the vehicle out of harm's way. In this paper, we argue that a viable third alternative exists -- on failure of the self-driving function in the vehicle, the system could return control to a remote human driver located in response centers distributed across the world. This remote human driver will augment the self-driving system in vehicles, only when failures occur, which may be due to bad weather, malfunction, contradiction in sensory inputs, and other such conditions. Of course, a remote driving extension is fraught with many challenges, including the need for some Quality of Service guarantees, both in latency and throughput, in connectivity between the vehicles on the road and the response center, so that the remote drivers can react efficiently to the road conditions. To understand some of the challenges, we have set up real-time streaming testbed and evaluate frame latency with different parameter settings under today's LTE and Wi-Fi networks. While additional optimization techniques can be applied to further reduce streaming latency, we recognize that significant new design of the communication infrastructure is both necessary and possible.},

Herewith, remote operation is introducing several challenges, as limited perception and difficulty in maintaining Situation Awareness (SA). In this regard, this research provides first-hand SA requirements for remote teleoperation-based interfaces. Complementary to a previous literature review on requirements for Human-Machine Interface for unmanned systems, we conducted two (N = 18, N = 10) user studies. To ascertain the views of the users, we employed two methodologies, in-depth interviews, and traditional statistical analysis to find out specific preferences. We collected a total of 80 statements that we could cluster over 12 categories, presenting a comprehensive overview of SA user requirements. The research is envisioned to be used by others as a tool to help the development of AV teleoperation-based interfaces.},

Wi-Fi Goes to Town APs make delivery decisions to the vehicular clients they serve at millisecond-level granularities, exploiting path diversity in roadside networks. In order to accomplish this, we introduce new buffer management algorithms that allow participating APs to manage each others' queues, rapidly quenching each others' transmissions and flushing each others' queues. We furthermore integrate our fine-grained AP selection and queue management into 802.11's frame aggregation and block acknowledgement functions, making the system effective at modern 802.11 bit rates that need frame aggregation to maintain high spectral efficiency. We have implemented our system in an eight-AP network alongside a nearby road, and evaluate its performance with mobile clients moving at up to 35 mph. Depending on the clients' speed, Wi-Fi Goes to Town achieves a 2.4-4.7x TCP throughput improvement over a baseline fast handover protocol that captures the state of the art in Wi-Fi roaming, including the recent IEEE 802.11k and 802.11r standards.},

Yet, the communication delay is one of the major challenges that jeopardize system stability and transparency. Vehicle trajectory prediction as the Predictive Display (PD) is the state-of-the-art technique to mitigate this problem. However, its effectiveness is highly dependent on the remote vehicle inputs and actual communication latency. To solve this issue, we propose a new model that considers the operator inputs in the control loop. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, an evaluation was conducted. The novel predictive model was implemented in the BMW R\&D virtual simulator. Experimental results show that the proposed model predicts the vehicle states with 7.3\% less euclidean deviation.},

Safety and reliability are assured by a human operator who remotely observes the vehicle and takes over control in cases of disturbances that exceed the vehicle automation’s skills. In order to integrate the vehicle’s automation and human remote-operation, we developed a novel user-centered human-machine interface (HMI) for teleoperation. It is tailored to the remote-operation of a highly automated shuttle (SAE 4) by a public transport control center and based on a systematic analysis of scenarios, of which detailed requirements were derived. Subsequently, a paper-pencil prototype was generated and refined until a click-dummy emerged. This click-dummy was evaluated by twelve control center professionals. The experts were presented the prototype in regular mode and were then asked to solve three scenarios with disturbances in the system. Using structured interview and questionnaire methodology, the prototype was evaluated regarding its usability, situation awareness, acceptance, and perceived workload. Results support our HMI design for teleoperation of a highly automated shuttle, especially regarding usability, acceptance, and workload. Participant ratings and comments indicated particularly high satisfaction with the interaction design to resolve disturbances and the presentation of camera images. Participants’ feedbacks provide valuable information for a refined HMI design as well as for further research.},

In order for teleoperation to function reliably and universal, it will make use of existing infrastructure, such as cellular networks. Unfortunately, cellular networks might suffer from variable performance. In this work, we investigate the effects of latency on task performance and perceived workload for different driving scenarios. Results from a simulator study (N=28) suggest that latency has negative influence on driving performance and subjective factors and led to a decreased confidence in Teleoperated Driving during the study. A latency of about 300 ms already led to a deteriorated driving performance, whereas variable latency did not consequently deteriorate driving performance.},

	abstract = {There is a large gap between current AI-based autonomous-driving cars and fully autonomous cars, where the remote control of vehicles can be a unique solution to fill the gap. The remote control enables valuable operational data to be obtained, thus laying the groundwork for gradually increasing autonomous driving performance in the future. Moreover, human assistance through remote driving can offer more flexibility and intelligence than a single artificial intelligence. However, the real-time transmission of data and images is particularly crucial for remotely driven vehicles. The latency between a vehicle and the controller depends on the video streaming communication methods and transport protocols. Furthermore, the control or driving performance also depends on the vehicle speed likewise. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the impact of different communication methods of video streaming and vehicle “speed” on the performance of remote driving. We design a vehicle remote driving system based on ROS (Robot Operating System) with ROS as the core communication architecture to realize remote control of vehicles. The video stream is transmitted using three different streaming methods: ROS multi-computer communication, TCP protocol, and UDP protocol. To be specific, we implement a simple remote driving system for a “model” car, drive it at different speeds, and analyze how the drivers perform in terms of whether the vehicle gets off the track while driving. Based on the results, we find that “UDP-based video streaming” achieves 720P video streaming with a latency of less than 50ms, which is helpful for further research on remote driving. The experiment by “directly” observing the vehicle with eyes instead of using video streaming is also conducted to remove the video streaming latency. The experiment results show that the speed of the vehicle and the video streaming methods have a significant impact on the driving performance, and UDP protocol-based video streaming method is better suited for remote driving. The results imply that remote driving should be used in a low-speed environment rather than at high speed.},

To enable teleoperated systems, two main problems have to be solved: Safely controlling the vehicle under latency, and presenting the sensor data from the vehicle to the operator in such a way, that the operator can easily understand the vehicles environment and the vehicles current state. While most of the teleoperation systems face similar challenges, the teleoperation of automated vehicles is unique in its scale, safety requirements and system constraints. Two major constraints are the round-trip-latency and the maximum upload-bandwidth. While the latency mainly influences the controllability and safety of the vehicle, the upload-bandwidth affects the amount of transmittable sensor data and therefore operators situation awareness, as well as the running costs of the whole system. The focus of this paper is measuring and reducing the end-to-end latency for a teleoperation setup. Therefore the latency is separated into actuator and sensor latency. For each part the different components and settings are analyzed in order to find a realistic minimal end-to-end latency for the teleoperation of automated vehicles. Therefore new measurement methods are developed and existing methods adapted.},

In this study, we focus on automation for mobility service and don’t deal with automation for privately owned vehicles. If level 4 automation is used, no drivers on board can be realized. Considering automated vehicle services, level 4 automated vehicles should be monitored by remote operators, and remote operators are expected for managing automated vehicles. One operator should manage more than two vehicles for the cost benefit. On managing or operating, there are interactions between a remote operator and an automated driving system. Human factor issues and adequate human machine interface between a remote operator and the system should be considered. Thus, we exposed the issues related to human factor between them by categorizing the number of vehicles. We are working on social implementation of automated vehicle services, which has been supported by the government in Japan. Also, we have a plan to do the experiments with real automated bus and a remote operation system, which were developed in order to clarify these human factors.},

abstract = {Automated vehicles are about to enter the mass market. However, such systems regularly meet limitations of varying criticality. Even basic tasks such as Object Identification can be challenging, for example, under bad weather or lighting conditions or for (partially) occluded objects. One common approach is to shift control to manual driving in such circumstances, however, post-automation effects can occur in these control transitions. Therefore, we present ORIAS, a system capable of asking the driver to (1) identify/label unrecognized objects or to (2) select an appropriate action to be automatically executed. ORIAS extends the automation capabilities, prevents unnecessary takeovers, and thus reduces post-automation effects. This work defines the capabilities and limitations of ORIAS and presents the results of a study in a driving simulator (N=20). Results indicate high usability and input correctness.},

abstract="As long as automated vehicles are not able to handle driving in every possible situation, drivers will still have to take part in the driving task from time to time. Recent research focused on handing over control entirely when automated systems reach their boundaries. Our overview on research in this domain shows that handovers are feasible, however, they are not a satisfactory solution since human factor issues such as reduced situation awareness arise in automated driving. In consequence, we suggest to implement cooperative interfaces to enable automated driving even with imperfect automation. We recommend to consider four basic requirements for driver--vehicle cooperation: mutual predictability, directability, shared situation representation, and calibrated trust in automation. We present research that can be seen as a step towards cooperative interfaces in regard to these requirements. Nevertheless, these systems are only solutions for parts of future cooperative interfaces and interaction concepts. Future design of interaction concepts in automated driving should integrate the cooperative approach in total in order to achieve safe and comfortable automated mobility.",
