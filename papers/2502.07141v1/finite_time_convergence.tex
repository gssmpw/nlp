\section{\textcolor{red}{Finite-time Convergence}}


\begin{itemize}
    \item high-level intuitions: transferring asymptotic arguments to their finite-time correspondences.
    \item a pair of two actions get sampled for $\Omega(\log{T})$ times with high probability.
    \item with high probability then actions' parameters have to shift largely if actions are sampled for enough many times with high probability.
    \item optimal action has to be sampled for enough many times with high probability (contradiction based arguments)
    \item then with high probability, optimal action wins over other sub-optimal actions.
\end{itemize}
