%Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional skill in performing tasks based on instructions. 
%Yet, this strength can turn into a vulnerability when models encounter instructions they must struggle to disregard.

%However, this strength can become a vulnerability when models are required to disregard certain instructions.

Despite the fact that large language models (LLMs) show exceptional skill in instruction following tasks, this strength can turn into a vulnerability when the models are required to disregard certain instructions.
Instruction-following tasks typically involve a clear task description and input text containing the target data to be processed. However, when the input itself resembles an instruction, confusion may arise, even if there is explicit prompting to distinguish between the task instruction and the input. We refer to this phenomenon as \textit{instructional distraction}. 
In this paper, we introduce a novel benchmark, named \textbf{DIM-Bench}, specifically designed to assess LLMs' performance under instructional distraction. 
The benchmark categorizes real-world instances of instructional distraction and evaluates LLMs across four \textit{instruction} tasks: rewriting, proofreading, translation, and style transfer---alongside five \textit{input} tasks: reasoning, code generation, mathematical reasoning, bias detection, and question answering.
Our experimental results reveal that even the most advanced LLMs are susceptible to instructional distraction, often failing to accurately follow user intent in such cases.

\section*{Limitations}
In this study, various tasks commonly used in data processing with LLMs are addressed. However, tasks such as summarization, where multiple valid output forms may exist depending on the user's intent—i.e., one-to-many tasks—are not considered. For example, one user might view a structured summary as the desired output, while another might prefer a simplified explanation, discarding the multiple-choice format in favor of a brief, open-ended response. This ambiguity makes it challenging to assess whether the output faithfully follows the instruction using an LLM-based judge when multiple valid outputs are possible. Nevertheless, we manually verified that summarization tasks are also vulnerable to instructional distraction. For instance, in question-answering tasks, the model might bypass summarization entirely and proceed directly to solving the problem, thus deviating from the instruction. The investigation of instructional distraction in one-to-many tasks remains an avenue for future work.

\section*{Ethics Statement}

In our benchmark setup, all datasets utilized were publicly available and applied for their intended purposes. Additionally, we performed our evaluations using GPT models accessed through OpenAI's official website\footnote{\url{https://openai.com/}}. Similarly, Qwen 2.5~\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/collections/Qwen/qwen25-66e81a666513e518adb90d9e}} and Llama 3.1 models~\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/collections/meta-llama/llama-31-669fc079a0c406a149a5738f}} were obtained via official source, following proper authorization protocols. Also, all models used in our experiments were sourced from publicly accessible platforms, such as websites and GitHub repositories, in alignment with open science principles. While writing this paper, we employed an AI assistant to help draft and refine sentences at the sentence level.
