\section*{Limitations}

While our framework outperforms various baseline approaches in LLM evaluation, there is still room for improvement. Our method is limited to using code to enhance evaluation robustness and does not consider additional tools such as search engines or specialized agents. Furthermore, our approach partially relies on the LLM's own reasoning ability for evaluation. If the LLM itself lacks strong reasoning capabilities, the effectiveness of refinement may be limited. Additionally, our evaluation is restricted to pairwise comparisons and does not enhance the model's ability to score single responses. Although single-response scoring can be achieved by modifying the Refiner’s prompt, its accuracy has not been properly aligned.
