\subsection{Live-Streaming Recommendation}
Live-streaming is a new media that has emerged in recent years, which allows users and authors to communicate and interact in real time, and has widely attracted the public and has accumulated a large user group. 
%
In recent years, live-streaming has gradually become professionalized, and a number of high-quality platforms have emerged, such as Kuaishou (Chatting, Shopping), Twitch (Gaming) and so on.
%
In industry, the Twitch proposed a representative work the LiveRec____ to consider the users repeat watching pattern and utilize the attention mechanism to capture the watching frequency.
%
Later, considering users watch different live-streaming times of spans a large range, the Twitch proposed a re-weighting technique____ to increase long-view samples weight adaptively.
%
To model the user-item relationship more fine-grained, the MMBee____ introduces the user-author graph to capture higher-order user-item connection information via different meta-paths.
%
With the wave of multi-modal learning, the MTA____ and ContentCTR____ are proposed to model live-streaming content as an additional feature.
%
Besides, to fulfill user interests, there are some works eLiveRec____ to consider the users other interaction behaviours in product/short-video domain.
%
In data-streaming designing for live-streaming, the Cross\&Moment____ describes the fast-slow window and 30s-window paradigm to train model in a real-time manner.
%
Compared with them, our LiveForesighter is from a new perspective to enhance live-streaming recommendation via generate future information, and further providing solutions to alleviate the following challenges:
%
(1) \textit{for a live-streaming, what moment is the best timing to distribute?}
%
(2) \textit{in addition to the current moment, does the future content also meet users interests?}
%
With the live-streaming side user-behaviour statistic and product sequences, our LiveForesighter achieves a disentanglement generative paradigm to achieve more smart live-streaming RecSys.







\subsection{Generative Models in Recommendation}
Generative models have been widely studied in recent years with the explosive development of natural language processing.
%
The elaborate works of generative models are GPTs____, which stack large-scale Transformer architectures to learn the natural language corpus to generate next token.
%
With the success of GPTs, there are many fields have been revolutionized by generative models, such as the visual modeling KLing____, time series forecasting Timer____, speech modeling FunAudioLLM____ and so on. 
%

For the recommendation area, the revolution of large generative models is gradually beginning.
%
At the retrieval stage, the KuaiFormer____ employs the Transformer as backbone to extract multiple user interests representation.
%
Meanwhile, the TIGER____ and LIGER____ utilize the LLM-generated Semantic ID to model user historical sequence with beam-search technique to generate the thousands of item candidate Semantic ID for more comprehensive retrieval.
%
The NoteLLM____ and QARM____ utilize the item-item relationship to finetune the LLM to provide more friendly representation for recommendation model.
%
At the ranking stage, the HSTU____ devise a generative multi-layer Transformer framework to replace wide-used ranking model to rank user and multiple items at same time.
%
Besides, MARM____ applies the KV-cache technique to achieve a low-computation paradigm, to scale the Transformers in ranking model efficiently.
%
The HLLM____ utilizes the pre-trained language model to act as ranking model, which uses the multi-modal singals to represent items representation and user interests.
%
Compared with them, our LiveForesighter also follows the generative paradigm but with distinct motivations to predict future live-streaming information with Transformers.
