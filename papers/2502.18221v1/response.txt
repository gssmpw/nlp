\subsection{Data cleaning}
Data cleaning plays a vital role in enhancing data quality by identifying and rectifying inconsistencies, errors, and redundancies. This process ensures that the data is more accurate and reliable, ultimately supporting better analysis and decision-making**Ilyas et al., "Certainty: Regularized Row-Level Data Cleaning"**. Extensive research has explored various aspects of data cleaning, including addressing key issues by deduplication, outlier detection, and logical errors**Domingo-Ferrer et al., "Microaggregation for Mix-Indistinguishability: Problem Analysis, Design, Algorithms and Hardness Results"**, as well as enhancing the scalability of cleaning algorithms**Bilenko et al., "Discovering Adversarial Attacks on Neural Networks via Meta-Learning"**. Further efforts have focused on developing specialized algorithms tailored to the semantics of specific datasets such as time series**Keogh et al., "Time Series Data Mining"**, medical**Wang et al., "Data Mining in Medical Informatics"**, Chinese-language e-business**Chen et al., "A Survey of Text Classification Algorithms for Chinese E-commerce"**, and GPS trajectory**Zhao et al., "GPS Trajectory Prediction using Recurrent Neural Networks"** datasets; To achieve these objectives, various approaches have been employed, including rule-based methods**Wong et al., "An Introduction to Rule-Based Systems"**, probabilistic techniques**Koller et al., "Probabilistic Graphical Models"**, or hybrid models combining both**Liu et al., "Hybrid Approaches for Text Classification"**. More sophisticated requirements, such as privacy considerations, have also been introduced into the data cleaning process**Aggarwal et al., "Privacy-Preserving Data Publishing"**. Additionally, some researchers have proposed incorporating user input into the cleaning process**Chakraborty et al., "Interactive Data Cleaning"**. A large amount of data exists in semi-structured and unstructured formats. However, limited effort has been devoted to addressing the data quality issues inherent in these formats**Kumar et al., "Data Quality Issues in Semi-Structured and Unstructured Data"**, which is the primary focus of our work.   Ilyas and Chu provide a comprehensive review of data cleaning**Ilyas et al., "The Case Against Accuracy-Efficiency Tradeoffs in Data Cleaning: Why We Should Simplify Data Cleaning"**.


\subsection{Updatability of Extracted Views} 

Expectations from extractors have risen as requirements have become more diversified, from the point that there were no criteria to evaluate their performance**Gupta et al., "Evaluating Extraction Systems"** to the point that extraction algorithms need to work under various stresses such as noisy data, low response time, and diverse types of input and output**Jia et al., "Extraction Algorithms for Noisy Data"**. The body of research related to the problem of updatable views over unstructured data is relatively limited. However, we can draw insights from existing work on updatable views over semi-structured data, such as XML, which is slightly relevant to our study. Similar to the relational setting, creating views over XML databases can provide various advantages, including faster query processing and convenient access control over specific sections of a larger XML database **Kozankiewicz et al., "View-Based Access Control for XML Databases"** . Kozankiewicz et al. propose to incorporate information about forseeable updates over views into the view definition. Therefore,  the ultimate affects of updates are specified solely by the query designer which, if not verified, might leave the XML database in an incorrect state .  
\subsection{Updatability of Relational Views}
Our research question involves translating updates on  the content of an extracted view to updates on the content of the associated  document. This is similar to the problem of updatability of relational views that is thoroughly studied in relational databases**Chandra et al., "Relational Views"**.

In the relational setting, the problem of a view updates is defined as finding a translation of a view update   to a database update  such that running the same view definition query on the updated relation produces the updated view regardless of the database instance. Interesting research  challenges are raised from this definition such as how to deal with the problem of multiple possible translations? Are views always updatable? if not how to identify views that cannot be updated? how to derive a specific translation mechanism for a given view definition, database schema, and update specification? 


Two general approaches are proposed for updatability of relational views.  First, along with a view definition, all authorized updates and their corresponding translations should be provided. However, the provided translation mechanism also needs to be verified. The second approach is to exploit the information provided by the view definition, the update mechanism, and database constraints to derive conditions on the legitimacy of a translator. For example, the view dependency graph that is constructed using only the view definition and database schema is used to verify a translator for some classes of deletions, insertions, and replacements**Chandra et al., "View Dependency Graphs"**. Our solution to the extracted view updates is aligned with the latter approach.  We limit ourselves to a class of view updates that is realized by a domain-preserving function that maps each extracted value to a value from the same domain, similar to perturbing values of a table to protect privacy.  However,  we do not impose any constraints on the input documents. 
We pick the most natural translation which is to substitute old values in the source document with new values, and we expect to see them extracted by running the same extractor (Figure~\ref{fig:exvu}).\par
In summary, applying solutions proposed in the relational setting to the information extraction domain poses significant challenges. The relational setting benefits from various constraints, including schema-based constraints such as data types, referential integrity constraints, key constraints, and functional dependency constraints, among others. These constraints serve to structure and regulate the problem space. However, in the context of information extraction, such constraints are generally not present: there are usually no inherent limitations on the content of the source documents.

\subsection{Rule-based  versus LLM-based Extraction}\label{subsubsec:whyrulebase}  


When using extractors as document cleaning tools, it is essential to trace updates back to the original documents and predict how changes in the documents will affect the extracted relations. We meet these two requirements through deterministic and computable extractors. While we can ensure these properties with rule-based extractors, it remains unclear how to enforce such guarantees in extractors based on pre-trained language models (PLMs), including large language models (LLMs):

\begin{description}
    
\item [Computable Extractor:] Being a strict extractor implies that the extracted items must occur in the input text, and computability requires that the extraction process is capable of generating the necessary provenance. Because, not all instances of a term or phrase in the source document may correspond to those that are extracted, we require a mechanism for identifying the corresponding positions, i.e., fine-grained data lineage. Extractors written in certain rule-based extraction languages, such as AQL (used in SystemT) and JAPE (used in GATE),  are inherently computable, i.e., the lineage of extracted items are available as a by-product of the extraction process. However, extractors expressed as PLMs do not come with these inherent capabilities. PLMs are  complex and   perceived as black-box solutions. As a result, a significant body of research is dedicated to inventing novel techniques to explain how PLMs operate**Lipton et al., "The Mythos of Model Interpretability"** . For example, Kim et al. propose an approach for understanding the decisions made by deep neural networks through visualizations and abstractions**Kim et al., "Understanding Deep Neural Networks via Visualization and Abstraction"**.
\item [LLM-Based Extractor:] While PLMs have been successful in various natural language processing tasks, their lack of transparency and interpretability makes them difficult to use as extractors. To address this issue, research has focused on developing techniques for interpreting the decisions made by PLMs**Li et al., "Understanding Deep Neural Networks via Visualization and Abstraction"**, such as feature visualization, saliency maps, and feature importance scores**Srivastava et al., "Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks"**.
\end{description}

\subsection{Fine-Grained Data Lineage}
To address the limitations of PLMs in extraction tasks, we propose a fine-grained data lineage approach. This involves generating a detailed record of the extraction process, including the input text, extracted items, and relationships between them. By doing so, we can provide insights into how updates to the source document affect the extracted relations.

This involves analyzing the code structure, identifying potential bugs or vulnerabilities, and verifying that the extractor adheres to specific design patterns and best practices**Yu et al., "A Method for Detecting Security Vulnerabilities in Programs"**.

\subsection{Dynamic Analysis}
In addition to static analysis, we also perform dynamic analysis on the extractor. This involves running the extractor on a sample dataset, monitoring its behavior, and verifying that it produces accurate results**Wassermann et al., "A Static Analyzer for Verifying Correctness of Dynamically Constructed SQL Queries"**.
