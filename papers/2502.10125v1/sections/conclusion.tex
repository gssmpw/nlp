In this paper, we theoretically and empirically demonstrate that properly aligned data are more effectively learned by machine learning models compared to misaligned data. Building on this observation, we propose an integrated model, \emph{Leal}, which seamlessly combines soft alignment and learning for tabular data. We conduct extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets to validate the effectiveness of Leal. Looking ahead, we believe that latent alignment learning represents a promising direction for advancing machine learning to leverage the widely available heterogeneous tabular data without shared features.
