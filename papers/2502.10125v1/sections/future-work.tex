In the future, we aim to extend the model to handle multiple relational tables. The primary challenges are overfitting and efficiency due to the involvement of numerous tables. Successfully addressing these challenges would enable knowledge fusion across real-world tabular data without shared features, supporting more applications in unsupervised multi-modal learning and vertical federated learning.

Additionally, we aim to develop efficient methods for identifying relationships between tables. While training a Leal model to evaluate table relationships by performance is feasible, it is computationally expensive and lacks scalability. Exploring efficient approaches could significantly enhance knowledge integration across tables.
