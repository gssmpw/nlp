% \section{Related Work} \label{sec:2}
% To provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed method, we first review existing hyperspectral target detection (HTD) techniques that primarily focus on ground targets, along with the challenges involved in adapting these methods to underwater environments. 
% Subsequently, we detail recent advancements in HUTD that address these challenges and compare them with the proposed method. 
% Finally, we summarize the characteristics of existing HUTD benchmark datasets and compare them with the newly introduced ATR-HUTD dataset.

% \subsection{Hyperspectral Target Detection}
% HTD focuses on identifying targets that match known spectral signatures in HSIs. 
% These known spectra, regarded as priors, are typically obtained from a spectral library or reference images before detection.
% Given the unique advantage of rich spectral information in HSIs, this field has garnered increasing attention in recent years.
% For example,
