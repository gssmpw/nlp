\textbf{Ensemble Learning in LLMs.} Many works exploit majority voting to perform inference-time ensemble  ____. The downside of majority voting is the definition of equality between divergent answers. %Compared to math problems or multiple-choice problems, consensus-based approaches like weighted majority voting may do poorly for generative queries. 
Two threads of research further improve majority voting, one work utilizes the BLEU score as the heuristic to compare answers ____ another is to enhance the BLEU score-based answer combination method by either assigning weights ____ or by creating a debate environment ____. Due to the lengthy and complex prompt strategies of former works, supervised summarization LLM ensemble methods are proposed ____.

\textbf{Ensemble Reinforcement Learning.} Creating an adaptive ensemble model with RL such as ____ is an extensive area covered in many contexts such as time-series prediction, ____, ensemble pruning ____, and in context of LLMs ____. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first approach in adapting reinforcement learning for both the pruning and generation stage in the context of LLMs.
