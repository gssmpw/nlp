\xhdr{Summary}
In this work, we explored the association between the nutritional density of food-related posts on Reddit's r/Food community and user engagement.
By estimating the nutritional content with an innovative embedding-based method just from post titles and analyzing almost $600,000$ posts, we uncover that nutritional information is predictive of engaging and posts resonating with the community.
Our findings suggest that posts featuring nutrient-dense meals are positively associated with both engagement and resonance, even after controlling for non-food-related factors.
This work expands on previous studies by focusing on only textual information for estimating nutritional content and conducting a large-scale analysis of the relationship between nutritional density and engagement, highlighting the role of nutritional content.

\xhdr{Implications}
The underlying study has several implications.
First, it provides insights into the driving factors behind user engagement with food-related content online. We uncover patterns that drive user behavior by employing large-scale analysis and exploring the intersection of technology, nutrition, and social engagement. More specifically, we provide information on the nutritional and general characteristics of posts users engage with.
Next, the explainability of our models allows us to structure the posts that are more likely to garner engagement. This allows the design of impactful online initiatives aimed at promoting healthy eating choices.
Furthermore, the improved estimation of nutritional content solely from textual description provides an accessible and scalable tool for dietary education, offering individuals a way to understand the profile of their meals.
These applications might encourage users to make informed decisions about their dietary habits and health.
Finally, our findings contribute to the broader discourse on how technology shapes social outcomes and practices, especially in the area of health.

\xhdr{Future Work}
Future work could incorporate features like image aesthetics, given the visual-centric nature of Reddit. In addition to further explaining engagement patterns, visual features could be used to improve the accuracy of nutritional estimation.
Moreover, extending our analysis to other social media platforms can provide a comparison of engagement patterns across diverse communities.
Finally, while our study analyzes correlation between nutritional density and engagement, future studies could also explore causal relationships, potentially using experimental and quasi-experimental designs.
