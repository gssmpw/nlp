%% rgb.tex
%% this file defines the X11 rgb color names for use with pstricks
%% put \usepackage{pstricks, pstcol} in the preamble of your document
%% the put \input{rgb.tex} in the body of your document.
%% Color in pstricks works like a switch.  If you enter
%%    The text will become \color{red}red.
%% Then all text after the \color command will printed in red in the
%% postscript file.  You can restrict the range of the red text in this
%% manner
%%    One {\color{red}some text} will be red.
%% The color will NOT show up in the dvi file, only in the .ps file!
