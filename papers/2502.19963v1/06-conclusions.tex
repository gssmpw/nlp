\section{Conclusions and Future Work}%
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we have investigated the role of truth assignment enumeration in OMT solving, and proposed some ways for exploiting partial truth assignments for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the search. 
In particular, we have proposed a truth assignment reduction strategy that takes advantage of the properties of the optimization problem to accurately choose the atoms to remove from the truth assignment.

We have implemented the proposed strategies in the \optimathsat{} solver, and evaluated them on a set of \omlarat{} benchmarks.
Our experimental results show that the proposed strategies can significantly improve the performance of the solver, uniformly reducing the overall solving time for optimal solving, and finding much better solutions for anytime solving. 

The results also show that the proposed strategies are particularly effective in reducing the number of search iterations needed to find the optimum solution. 
This makes it very promising for their applicability in OMT problems where the incrementality of SMT calls is poorly effective, such as in the case of \laint{}.

In future work, we plan to investigate similar truth-assignment reduction techniques for other SMT theories, in particular \laint{}.
