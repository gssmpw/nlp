A general OMT-solving
strategy~\cite{nieuwenhuisSATModuloTheories2006,sebastianiOptimizationSMTLAQ2012,sebastianiOptimizationModuloTheories2015}
consists in performing a sequence of incremental SMT calls, progressively
tightening the range of values for the objective function.
%
Specifically, an \smt{} solver is used to enumerate \T-satisfiable truth
assignments that propositionally satisfy the problem formula $\vi$. For each
such truth assignment, a \T-optimizer finds a \T-model of optimum cost within
it. A constraint is then added to the formula to tighten the upper bound for
the cost of the optimum model, and the search continues until the formula is
found unsatisfiable.
Besides optimal solving, an important feature of \omt{}
solvers is the ability to provide the user with a good-enough solution within a
given time budget. This capability, known as \emph{anytime} OMT solving, is
especially valuable in industrial applications where finding the optimum solution may be computationally impractical, and it is rather more important to obtain high-quality solutions quickly.

\omt{} techniques have been developed for \larat{}~\cite{bjornerNZOptimizingSMT2015,sebastianiOptimizationModuloTheories2015}, \laint{}~\cite{bjornerNZOptimizingSMT2015,sebastianiPushingEnvelopeOptimization2015}, \nlarat~\cite{bigarellaOptimizationModuloNonlinear2021}, \nlaint~\cite{bigarellaOptimizationModuloNonlinear2021}, \bv~\cite{nadelBitVectorOptimization2016,trentinOptimizationModuloTheories2021}, and \fl~\cite{trentinOptimizationModuloTheories2021}.
Also, \omt{} has been extended to deal with multiple objectives including lexicographic \omt{}~\cite{bjornerNZOptimizingSMT2015,sebastianiPushingEnvelopeOptimization2015}, boxed \omt{}~\cite{bjornerNZOptimizingSMT2015,liSymbolicOptimizationSMT2014,sebastianiPushingEnvelopeOptimization2015}, min-max \omt{}~\cite{sebastianiOptiMathSATToolOptimization2020}, and Pareto \omt{}~\cite{bjornerNZOptimizingSMT2015}. %, which have all been implemented in the \omt{} solver \optimathsat{}~\cite{sebastianiOptiMathSATToolOptimization2020}.

Recently, a Generalized OMT calculus has been proposed, extending the
definition to objectives over partially ordered
sets~\cite{tsiskaridzeGeneralizedOptimizationModulo2024}.

\paragraph{Partial assignments enumeration SMT.}%
\label{sec:related-work-partial-assignments}

The problem of truth assignment enumeration has been studied in recent years,
mainly in the context of SAT and \smt{} enumeration (AllSAT and AllSMT).
% Many applications of SAT and \smt{} solving and related tasks can benefit from finding (short) partial truth assignments.
Typically, enumeration
algorithms~\cite{lahiriSMTTechniquesFast2006,friedAllSATCombinationalCircuits2023,friedEntailingGeneralizationBoosts2024,spallittaDisjointPartialEnumeration2024}
rely their efficiency on the enumeration of partial assignments to reduce both
the number of enumerated assignments and the computational time by up to an
exponential factor.
%, since a partial assignment can be extended to $2^k$ total truth assignments, where $k$ is the number of unassigned atoms.
%
Several techniques have been proposed to find short satisfying partial
assignments starting from a total assignment, trading off efficiency for
effectiveness
(e.g.,~\cite{morgadoGoodLearningImplicit2005,raviMinimalAssignmentsBounded2004,todaImplementingEfficientAll2016}).
%A very simple algorithm to find \emph{minimal} partial assignments, implemented e.g., in \mathsat{}~\cite{mathsat5_tacas13}, consists in iteratively dropping literals one-by-one from the satisfying total assignment, checking if it still satisfies the formula. 
Also, the impact of CNF-ization on the effectiveness of partial assignment
reduction has been recently studied
in~\cite{masinaCNFConversionDisjoint2023,spallittaEnhancingSMTbasedWeighted2024}.
