% define what is the prehensile manipulation skill
Each domain has a single prehensile (P) skill, which manipulates its respective object (card, book, or cup) while maintaining a grasp. The prehensile skill begins by grasping the object at the relative grasp pose with respect to object and then places it in the desired object pose. The robot grasps the object based on the relative grasp poses for each object type, as described in Appendix~\ref{Appendix:Object}.

For each domain, the prehensile skill $K_\text{P}$ of each domain defined as below.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Card Flip Domain: A P skill that moves a card within \( \Qobj \) while maintaining a grasp on it. 
    \item Bookshelf Domain: A P skill that moves a book from the upper bookshelf to the lower bookshelf while maintaining a grasp on it. 
    \item Kitchen Domain: A P skill that moves a cup from the sink and places it into a cupboard while maintaining a grasp on it.
\end{itemize}

% relative grasp poses
\textcolor{red}{For each object in each domain, we pre-define the relative grasp poses as }

As mentioned in Section~\ref{method:PF}, each skill has two functions: an applicability condition \( \phi \) and a goal-conditioned policy \( \pi \). The P skill follows this definition as well.

For the applicability condition $\phi$ of P skill, we first compute the grasp poses in the world frame. We derive two sets of grasp poses: the first set is based on the current object pose and the relative grasp poses, while the second set is based on the desired object pose and the relative grasp poses. Next, we solve the inverse kinematics (IK) for each set of grasp poses using the IK-fast solver~\cite{diankov_thesis}. For each set, we generate a set of feasible grasp poses that are both IK-feasible and collision-free within each domain. If both sets contain feasible grasp poses computed from the same relative grasp pose, the applicability condition is satisfied. If either condition is not met, the applicability condition is not satisfied.

Prehensile manipulation skills policy $\pi_\text{P}$ are trained using RL for each domain.
