\caption{\texttt{Skill-RRT} computation time analysis: Detailed breakdown of \texttt{Skill-RRT} computation time, highlighting the planning and inference times for each domain: Card Flip, Bookshelf, and Kitchen.}\label{table:skill_rrt_time}
\end{table*}

The table~\ref{table:skill_rrt_time} outlines the components of the computation time for the algorithm \texttt{Skill-RRT}, which corresponds to the row labeled \texttt{Skill-RRT}(low-level action) and \texttt{Skill-RRT}(skill action) in Table~\ref{table:main_exp}.
 % \Romannum{1} in the main paper.
As shown in the table, the inference time is very short, while the planning time accounts for the majority of the computation time. Due to the high planning time, using \texttt{Skill-RRT}, where the skill plan is collected once and executed with closed-loop policies without adapting the plan based on the current state, becomes impractical in real-world settings. The requirement to wait 1.5 to 2 minutes before each task, combined with a lower success rate compared to the distillation policy, further limits its practicality.
