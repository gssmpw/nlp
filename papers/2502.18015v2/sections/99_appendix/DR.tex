For sim-to-real transfer, we apply domain randomization throughout the entire pipeline, including skill training, \texttt{Skill-RRT}, and data collection. To mimic perception noise, we inject noise into the object pose, robot joint positions, and end-effector pose. We apply different scales of noise to the object pose, as the perception noise of the object pose increases depending on the environment. For example, when a book is fitted between two other books in the bookshelf domain, the noise in the object pose is larger because the book is only partially visible. We also randomize the friction of the environment since real-world friction is unknown and add random noise to the commanded torque to reflect real-world noise effects in robot controller.
