% For each domain, the set of skills consists of the following skills. An illustration of each skill is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:skill}.

As outlined Table \Romannum{3} in the Section~\ref{sec:Experiments}, each skill $K$ consists of two components: (1) an applicability checker $\phi$, and (2) a goal-conditioned policy $\pi$.

We explain each skill \( K \) in each domain, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:skill}, along with its applicability checker function \( \phi \).

\underline{\textbf{Card Flip domain:}} \label{env:card_flip_skill_descript}
\begin{itemize}
        \item[] The set of skills \(\mathcal{K}\) consists of two different skills: \(\{ K_{\text{NP}_\text{slide}}, K_\text{P}\}\). \label{skill:card_flip_library}
        \item \(K_{\text{NP}_\text{slide}}\): A NP skill that manipulates a card by sliding it between two poses within the region \(Q_\text{obj}\), ensuring that the card's orientation remains unchanged along the global \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. \label{skill:card_flip_slide}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( K_{\text{NP}_\text{slide}}.\phi(q_{\text{obj}}, q'_{\text{obj}}) \) determines whether an object can slide from \( q_{\text{obj}} \) to \( q'_{\text{obj}} \). It returns 1 if both poses belong to \( Q_{\text{obj}} \), and if both $\qobj$ and $q'_\text{obj}$ have identical orientations with respect to the global \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \(K_\text{P}\): A P skill that moves a card within \( \Qobj \) while maintaining a grasp on it. \label{skill:card_flip_place}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item $K_\text{P}.\phi(\qobj, \qobj')$ returns 1 if both the initial and desired object poses \( q_\text{obj}, q'_\text{obj} \) belong to the valid object pose space \( \Qobj \), and the computed pre-contact robot joint position \( q'_r = \pi_{\text{pre}}(s, q_{\text{obj}}, q'_{\text{obj}}) \) is collision-free and not null.

        \item \(K_{\text{NP}_\text{topple}}\): A NP skill that transitions a book from an upright pose to a toppled pose within the upper bookshelf region \(Q^\text{upper-shelf}_\text{obj}\), ensuring that the book maintains its alignment along the global \( x \)- and \( z \)-axes. \label{skill:bookshelf_topple}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( K_{\text{NP}_\text{topple}}.\phi(q_{\text{obj}}, q'_{\text{obj}}) \) determines whether an object on the upper shelf can transition between poses while toppling. It returns 1 if both poses belong to \( Q^\text{upper-shelf}_{\text{obj}} \) and if both $\qobj$ and $q'_\text{obj}$ have identical orientations with respect to the global \( x \)- and \( z \)-axes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \(K_{\text{NP}_\text{push}}\): A NP skill that moves a book deeper into the lower bookshelf region \(Q^\text{lower-shelf}_\text{obj}\) by pushing it, ensuring that the book retains its orientation along the global \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. \label{skill:bookshelf_push}

\end{itemize}

\underline{\textbf{Kitchen domain:}} \label{env:kitchen_skill_descript}
\begin{itemize}
        \item[] The set of skills \(\mathcal{K}\) consists of four different skills: \(\{ K_{\text{NP}_\text{sink}}, K_{\text{NP}_\text{l-cupboard}}, K_{\text{NP}_\text{r-cupboard}}, K_\text{P}\}\). \label{skill:kitchen_library}
        \item \(K_{\text{NP}_\text{sink}}\): A NP skill that manipulates a cup between two poses within the sink region \(Q_\text{obj}^\text{sink}\), ensuring that the cup remains within the boundaries of the sink throughout the movement. \label{skill:kitchen_sink}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( K_{\text{NP}_\text{sink}}.\phi(q_{\text{obj}}, q'_{\text{obj}}) \) determines whether an object on the sink can be manipulated. It returns 1 if both poses belong to \( Q_{\text{obj}}^{\text{sink}} \).

        \item \(K_{\text{NP}_\text{l-cupboard}}\): A NP skill that moves a cup within the region \(Q_\text{obj}^\text{l-cupboard}\), ensuring that the cup's orientation remains unchanged along the global \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. \label{skill:kitchen_lcupboard}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \( K_{\text{NP}_\text{l-cupboard}}.\phi(q_{\text{obj}}, q'_{\text{obj}}) \) determines whether an object on the left cupboard can be pushed. It returns 1 if both poses belong to \( Q^\text{l-cupboard}_{\text{obj}} \), and if both $\qobj$ and $q'_\text{obj}$ have identical orientations with respect to the global \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \(K_{\text{NP}_\text{r-cupboard}}\): A NP skill that moves a cup within the region \(Q_\text{obj}^\text{r-cupboard}\), ensuring that the cup's orientation remains unchanged along the global \( x \)- and \( y \)-axes. \label{skill:kitchen_rcupboard}

            \item \( K_{\text{NP}_\text{r-cupboard}}.\phi(q_{\text{obj}}, q'_{\text{obj}}) \) determines whether an object on the right cupboard can be pushed.

        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

Next, we explain the goal-conditioned policy for each skill \( K \). Each skill has its own policy \( \pi \). The goal-conditioned policy of skill \( K \), denoted \( K.\pi \), consists of two distinct components: (1) the pre-contact policy \( K.\pi_\text{pre} \), and (2) the post-contact policy \( K.\pi_\text{post} \). % , and (3) connector policy $\pi_C$.
\begin{itemize}
\item The pre-contact policy $K.\pi_\text{pre}$ computes the pre-contact robot joint positions $q'_r$ from $q_\text{obj}$ and target object poses $q'_\text{obj}$.
\item The post-contact policy $K.\pi_\text{post}$ computes a low-level action $a$, which includes changes of end-effector pose, proportional gain of joints, and damping of joints, to manipulate the object from current state $s$ and desired object pose $q'_\text{obj}$.
% \item The connector policy $\pi_C$ computes a low-level action $a$, which includes changes in the end-effector pose, proportional gain of joints, damping of joints, and absolute gripper width, to relocate the robot configuration from the current state $s$ to the pre-contact robot joint positions $q'_r$.
