\section{Conclusion}
\label{Conclusion}
Despite its many challenges, MU has great potential as a tool for AIA compliance. Because contemporary AI regulations tend to feature recurring principles \citep{doi:10.1080/13510347.2023.2196068, DIAZRODRIGUEZ2023101896}, this likely means that MU has great potential as a tool for compliance with other AI regulations too. To realize this potential, AI researchers should help solve the (sometimes critical) open technical problems logged by this position paper. Among other things, this includes work on identifying forget set data points, on resolving the privacy and performance trade-offs of MU, and on resolving the particular challenges to these use cases that generative model outputs present. While researchers investigate these open problems, lawmakers can support them by explicitly endorsing MU as a compliance tool for AI regulation requirements and, more acutely, resolving some of the particular legal ambiguities we have flagged in this position paper (\ref{footnote2},\ref{footnote7}). Working collaboratively, we can all help unlock MU’s potential to assist compliance with the AI regulation and, by extension, help safeguard the important social values these regulations encode. 

% \section*{Impact Statement}

% In essence, this position paper suggests research directions that will help MU evolve into a better tool for assisting AI regulation compliance. Because these AI regulations tend to protect important ethical and societal values around health and safety, non-discrimination, and more, we believe the impact of this paper, in striving to advance AI regulation compliance through MU, will ultimately be the advancement of those important values as well.
