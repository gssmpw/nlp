%Traffic flow prediction provides critical information for travel scheduling and public safety. However, the temporal variability and dynamic spatial changes of traffic data pose significant challenges for accurate forecasting. To capture the complex spatio-temporal heterogeneity, this paper proposes \textbf{\underline{S}}patiotemporal-aware \textbf{\underline{T}}rend-Seasonality \textbf{\underline{D}}ecomposition \textbf{\underline{N}}etwork (STDN) for traffic flow forecasting. Specifically, STDN incorporates graph structure learning and spatio-temporal embeddings learning to model and process sequence data and spatio-temporal data, respectively, and further explores the high-dimensional relationships between them. Subsequently, the data is divided into trend-cyclical and seasonal components in a simple but efficient manner for further processing. Finally, the data is encoded by an encoder for the two different types of data and decoded by a decoder. Particularly, since the existing real datasets are based on highways and do not adequately reflect the spatio-temporal changes within city, we release a new real-world dataset called JiNan to facilitate better development in this field. Extensive experiments conducted in real-world traffic prediction tasks demonstrate that \model achieves overall optimal performance, with great computational efficiency and data utilization. The source code of our method is available\footnote{https://github.com/xxxx}.

Traffic prediction is critical for optimizing travel scheduling and enhancing public safety, yet the complex spatial and temporal dynamics within traffic data present significant challenges for accurate forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel model, the  \textbf{\underline{S}}patiotemporal-aware \textbf{\underline{T}}rend-Seasonality \textbf{\underline{D}}ecomposition \textbf{\underline{N}}etwork (STDN). This model begins by constructing a dynamic graph structure to represent traffic flow and incorporates novel spatio-temporal embeddings to jointly capture global traffic dynamics. The representations learned are further refined by a specially designed trend-seasonality decomposition module, which disentangles the trend-cyclical component and seasonal component for each traffic node at different times within the graph. These components are subsequently processed through an encoder-decoder network to generate the final predictions. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that \model achieves superior performance with remarkable computation cost. Furthermore, we have released a new traffic dataset named JiNan, which features unique inner-city dynamics, thereby enriching the scenario comprehensiveness in traffic prediction evaluation.
