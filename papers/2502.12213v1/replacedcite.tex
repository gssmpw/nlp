\section{Related Works}
We discuss related works from three categories of methods highly relevant to our study. % such as LSTM ____ and Transformer ____. However, these approaches overlook the complex spatial correlations between sensors in the traffic network ____.

\textbf{GCN-based Models}. Methods such as STGCN ____ and DCRNN ____ combine graph convolution network (\textbf{GCN}) with sequential data to model traffic flows. To address the limitations of predefined graphs based on the traffic network, GWNet ____ and AGCRN ____ introduce adaptive graphs within GCNs, enhancing the capture of global and accurate spatial dependencies in traffic data. STGODE ____ utilizes tensor-based neural ODEs to mitigate the oversmoothing problem in deep GCNs. Subsequently, dynamic graph convolution ____ are utilized to incorporate more intrinsic dynamic information within the spatial structure. However, they lose the guidance of prior knowledge, which may lead to underfitting and overfitting.

\textbf{Attention-based Models}. Attention-based models such as GMAN ____ and ASTGCN ____ directly capture global temporal correlations between two time slices through attention mechanisms. Subsequent models like SSTBAN, STWave, and PDformer ____ extend this approach by integrating intrinsic spatial correlations with temporal dynamics through similar mechanisms. Although these models have achieved success in several aspects, they have not yet to fully leverage the potential of spatio-temporal embeddings within traffic sequence data.

\textbf{Decomposition-based Methods}. Decomposing time sequence data into the trend-cyclical and seasonal components has proven effective for prediction ____. D\textsuperscript{2}STGNN ____ distinguishes two different types of hidden temporal signals: diffusion signals and intrinsic signals, which intriguingly parallel the trend-cyclical and seasonal parts. Other models treat seasonal part as delay signals ____. STWave ____ adopts a unique approach by starting with the data itself, decomposing spatio-temporal data into trend and event components using wavelet transformations. However, these models overlook the unique characteristics across time and space.

% However, these models tend to overlook the intrinsic high-order interactions among nodes. In contrast, our model comprehensively addresses the complex correlations between spatio-temporal embeddings and traffic sequence data.

% However, these models overlook the intrinsic high-dimensional information across time and space. Compared to previous models, our model not only thoroughly considers the high-dimensional correlations between spatio-temporal embeddings and traffic sequence data, but also achieves higher accuracy with lower complexity.
