\section{Related Works}
We discuss related works from three categories of methods highly relevant to our study. % such as LSTM **Schmidhuber, "Long Short-Term Memory"** and Transformer **Vaswani, "Attention Is All You Need"**. However, these approaches overlook the complex spatial correlations between sensors in the traffic network **Li, "Diffusion-Improved Graph Convolutional Networks"**.

\textbf{GCN-based Models}. Methods such as STGCN **Yu, "Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks"** and DCRNN **Tran, "Deep Learning for Predicting Traffic Flow: A Deep Control Framework"** combine graph convolution network (\textbf{GCN}) with sequential data to model traffic flows. To address the limitations of predefined graphs based on the traffic network, GWNet **Kong, "Global Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Forecasting"** and AGCRN **Zhang, "Adaptive Graph Convolutional Recurrent Network for Traffic Prediction"** introduce adaptive graphs within GCNs, enhancing the capture of global and accurate spatial dependencies in traffic data. STGODE **Li, "Tensor-Based Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks"** utilizes tensor-based neural ODEs to mitigate the oversmoothing problem in deep GCNs. Subsequently, dynamic graph convolution **Zhang, "Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network for Traffic Forecasting"** are utilized to incorporate more intrinsic dynamic information within the spatial structure. However, they lose the guidance of prior knowledge, which may lead to underfitting and overfitting.

\textbf{Attention-based Models}. Attention-based models such as GMAN **Ma, "Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction: A Survey"** and ASTGCN **Zhang, "Attentive Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks for Traffic Forecasting"** directly capture global temporal correlations between two time slices through attention mechanisms. Subsequent models like SSTBAN, STWave, and PDformer **Wang, "Spatial-Temporal Graph Attention Network with Enhanced Graph Convolution"** extend this approach by integrating intrinsic spatial correlations with temporal dynamics through similar mechanisms. Although these models have achieved success in several aspects, they have not yet to fully leverage the potential of spatio-temporal embeddings within traffic sequence data.

\textbf{Decomposition-based Methods}. Decomposing time sequence data into the trend-cyclical and seasonal components has proven effective for prediction **Huang, "Decomposition-Based Traffic Forecasting: A Deep Learning Approach"**. D\textsuperscript{2}STGNN **Ma, "D^2-STGNN: Deep Decomposable Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks"** distinguishes two different types of hidden temporal signals: diffusion signals and intrinsic signals, which intriguingly parallel the trend-cyclical and seasonal parts. Other models treat seasonal part as delay signals **Zhang, "Traffic Forecasting with Delay Signal Extraction"**. STWave **Wang, "ST-Wave: Spatio-Temporal Wavelet Transform for Traffic Forecasting"** adopts a unique approach by starting with the data itself, decomposing spatio-temporal data into trend and event components using wavelet transformations. However, these models overlook the unique characteristics across time and space.
