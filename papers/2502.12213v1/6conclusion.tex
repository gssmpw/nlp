\section{Conclusion}
% In this paper, we introduce a novel spatiotemporal-aware trend-seasonality decomposition network, \model, which addresses the complexities of traffic flow prediction by effectively capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. The model constructs a dynamic graph structure and employs novel spatio-temporal embeddings to accurately represent traffic patterns. These representations are refined through a trend-seasonality decomposition module and processed by an encoder-decoder network, resulting in highly accurate predictions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate STDN's superior performance and efficiency. Additionally, the JiNan traffic dataset, featuring unique inner-city dynamics, has been introduced to enhance traffic prediction evaluation.

The model constructs a dynamic graph structure and employs spatio-temporal embeddings to divide trend-cyclical part and seasonal part by a trend-seasonality decomposition module and then processed by an encoder-decoder network. Through extensive experiments, STDN demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency. Additionally, we introduce the JiNan traffic dataset, featuring unique inner-city dynamics.

In this paper, we introduce a novel spatiotemporal-aware trend-seasonality decomposition network (STDN), which marks a pioneering approach in employing spatio-temporal embeddings to learn disentangled representations of traffic flow. The empirical evaluations conducted across three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of \model over existing models. The release of the new inner-city dataset JiNan can also enrich the scenario comprehensiveness in traffic forecasting evaluations.
