\section{Problem Formulation}
Let $\mathcal{C} = \{\mathbf{c}_i\}_{i = 1}^{N}$ denote the set of historical price data 
for $N$ 
cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others. 
For the $i$-th cryptocurrency, the sequence 
$\mathbf{c}_i = \{\mathbf{f}_t\}_{t = 1}^{T}$ consists of a
series of feature vectors $\mathbf{f}_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^{12}$. 
Each vector
$\mathbf{f}_{t}$ includes \textit{opening}, \textit{closing}, 
\textit{high}, \textit{low} prices, \textit{trading volume} along with the technical indicators such as \textit{stochastic \%k}, 
 \textit{stochastic \%d}, \textit{momentum}, \textit{williamâ€™s \%r}, 
 \textit{a/d oscillator}, \textit{disparity 7} and \textit{rate of change} of the $i$-th cryptocurrency on day $t$. 
In addition to the price and technical indicators data, a collection of news articles is gathered daily from Cointelegraph, a major news outlet in the cryptocurrency sector.
These collected articles are denoted as $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathbf{d}_t\}_{t = 1}^{T}$, where 
$\mathbf{d}_t = \{a_1, a_2, , \ldots,a_j, \ldots\}$ 
represents the set of articles for day $t$
where $a_j$ is the $j$-th news article.

Given the data described above, our objective is as follows: On day $t$, can we predict the closing price of a target cryptocurrency for the following day  (i.e., day $t+1$), using the $l$ days of historical market prices, technical indicators and corresponding cryptocurrency news as observations? This can be mathematically
formulated as
\begin{equation}
    \hat{p}_{t + 1}^{i} = g\left(\mathcal{C}_{t - l + 1: t}, \mathcal{D}_{t - l + 1: t}
    \right),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{p}_{t+1}^{i}$ represents the predicted closing price for the target cryptocurrency indexed as $i$ on the day $t + 1$, and $g$ denotes our proposed predictive model. This question is crucial for automated 
cryptocurrency trading, especially in the realm of medium-frequency trading strategies~\cite{10.48175/ijarsct-2194, 10.1556/2006.2021.00037}. 

%When $t = 1$, the task involves predicting the next day's closing 
%price, which is typical for medium-frequency trading. For $h = 7$, the forecast aims to 
%provide a short-term outlook. As $t$ increases, the focus shifts towards long-term outlook 
%predictions \cite{10.1556/2006.2021.00037}.

For the $i$-th cryptocurrency, the $\mathbf{c}_i = \{\mathbf{f}_t\}_{t = 1}^{T}$ is a sequence of feature vectors $\mathbf{f}_{t} \in \mathbb{R}^5$, where $\mathbf{f}_{t}$ includes \textit{opening}, \textit{closing}, \textit{high}, and \textit{low} prices, along with the \textit{trading volume} of the $i$-th cryptocurrency on day $t$.
Cryptocurrency news from Cointelegraph is also collected, denoted as $\mathcal{D} = \{\mathbf{d}_t\}_{t = 1}^{T}$, where $\mathbf{d}_t = \{d_j\}_{j=1}^{\vert\mathbf{d}_t\vert}$ represents the set of articles for day $t$. 
Our objective is to predict the next day's closing price of a target cryptocurrency using the past $L$ days of historical prices and news, formulated as:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{p}_{t + 1}^{i} = g\left(\mathcal{C}_{t - L + 1: t}, \mathcal{D}_{t - L + 1: t}
    \right),
\end{equation}
where $\hat{p}_{t+1}^{i}$ is the predicted closing price for cryptocurrency $i$ on day $t+1$, and $g$ is our proposed model. 
This prediction is crucial for medium-frequency cryptocurrency trading strategies~\cite{10.48175/ijarsct-2194, 10.1556/2006.2021.00037}.
