In this paper, we have proposed a sensitive property profile model for an RBAC policy. For this propose we have used two properties based on KL-divergence and mutual information extracted from check-in dataset. Based on the vulnerabilities of cloud architecture and the sensitive property profile, we have proposed resource scheduling  problem based on the  optimization pertaining to risk management. The problem is shown to be NP-complete. Accordingly, we have proposed two heuristics and presented their  simulation based performance results for $HSD$ and $LSD$ datacenters.
