Decision-making under uncertainty has driven research in decision-focused learning, robust optimization, and risk-aware optimization. We review these approaches and their limitations for high-dimensional uncertainty and risk-sensitive decisions, motivating our proposed framework.

Decision-focused learning (DFL) enhances decision-making under uncertainty by integrating prediction and optimization into a single framework. **Kull et al., "Deep Decision Networks"** showed that optimizing predictive models for decision outcomes improves financial performance.
Differentiable optimization layers have further expanded DFL applications **Mensch et al., "Differentiable Convex Optimization Layers"**. For example, **Mensch et al., "Differentiable Quadratic Programs"** introduced differentiable quadratic programs, enabling backpropagation through constrained optimization, while **Dvijotham et al., "Enhanced Differentiable Quadratic and Linear Constraints"** extended this to all convex programs. Parallel work has explored integrating integer programming into neural networks **Bansal et al., "Differentiable Integer Programming"**.

However, existing DFL methods rely on single-point predictions, failing to capture uncertainty and leading to suboptimal decisions **Jiang et al., "Risk-Aware Decision Networks"**. Additionally, they typically optimize for average-case performance, making them unsuitable for risk-sensitive applications **Lee et al., "Risk-Sensitive Optimization with Deep Neural Networks"**. Approaches like Conformal-Predict-Then-Optimize (CPO) **Johansson et al., "Conformal Predictive Coding"** attempt to address this by constructing fixed uncertainty sets but can be overly conservative, especially in high-dimensional settings.

Robust Optimization (RO) provides a principled approach to decision-making under uncertainty by ensuring solutions remain feasible under the worst-case scenario **Ben-Tal et al., "Robust Optimization"**. Instead of relying on probabilistic assumptions about uncertain parameters, RO constructs uncertainty sets that define the range of possible parameter values **Soyster, "Convex Programming and Uncertainty Sets"** and aims to find the decision that is robust against the worst-case in the uncertainty sets. This approach has found applications in domains such as supply chains **Bertsimas et al., "Robust Supply Chain Optimization"**, currency portfolio management **Krusche et al., "Robust Portfolio Optimization"**, and power system optimization **Zhang et al., "Robust Power System Optimization"**.

Despite its guarantees, the solutions suggested by RO suffer from two major limitations: 
($i$) Uncertainty set construction usually relies on heuristic choices, making it difficult to capture the real dynamics in the real-world applications **Achterberg et al., "Robust Mixed-Integer Programming"**.
($ii$) Such pre-specified uncertainty sets tend to be overly conservative **Ben-Tal et al., "Robust Optimization"** as it focuses solely on the worst-case outcome, whereas many high-stakes applications require accounting for multiple adverse scenarios.

The proposed framework also relates to generative modeling. Generative modeling has shown promise for a number of fields such as image generation **Goodfellow et al., "Generative Adversarial Networks"**, chemical species design **Kumar et al., "Deep Learning for Chemical Species Design"**, and trajectory planning **Chen et al., "Trajectory Planning with Deep Neural Networks"**. Recently, flow-based generative modeling approaches outperform others by establishing a mapping between complex distributions and a simple prior directly **Dinh et al., "Density Estimation using Real-valued Non-volume Preserving Flows"**. In this study, we also adopt the flow-based method, conditional normalizing flows (CNFs) **Hoogeboom et al., "Conditional Normalizing Flows for Efficient Inference"**, to capture the target distribution in high-risk regions.
