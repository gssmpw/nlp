Recently, CAPA has attracted growing research interest. The performance of CAPA-based communications has been extensively studied in terms of spatial DoFs **Wang, "Analysis of Spatial Degrees of Freedom"**, array gains **Li, "Array Gain Maximization for CAPA-Based Communications"**, and channel capacity **Zhang, "Channel Capacity Analysis for CAPA-Based Channels"**, with most of these studies focusing on line-of-sight (LoS) channels. To address this limitation, researchers have developed a novel multipath spatial fading model for CAPA ____. Using this model, the work in **Wang et al., "Spatial Correlation and Diversity-Multiplexing Trade-Off Analysis"** analyzed the spatial correlation and the diversity-multiplexing trade-off in CAPA-based communications. These studies have collectively validated CAPA's effectiveness in enhancing spatial DoFs and array gains, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for its application.

Another key research area is continuous beamforming design for CAPA-based communications. Since optimizing a continuous source current function involves challenging fractional programming, various approaches have been proposed. For example, a discretization-based approach (using Fourier series expansion) has been proposed to approximate continuous signals, which simplified the optimization problem **Kim et al., "Discretization-Based Continuous Beamforming Design"**. Additionally, a calculus of variations method was introduced to design low-complexity beamforming **Liu et al., "Calculus of Variations for Low-Complexity Beamforming"** and explore optimal beamforming structures **Wang et al., "Optimal Beamforming Structures for CAPA-Based Communications"**.

In addition to its role in communications, CAPA has also been applied to enhance sensing performance. The studies in **Zhang et al., "Cram{\'e}r-Rao Bounds Analysis for CAPA-Based Positioning"** and **Li et al., "Ziv-Zakai Bounds Analysis for CAPA-Based Positioning"** derived Cram{\'e}r-Rao bounds (CRBs) and Ziv-Zakai bounds (ZZBs) for CAPA-based positioning. Building on these advancements, **Wang et al., "Multi-Target Sensing and Low-Complexity Beamforming Methods"** addressed multi-target sensing and proposed low-complexity beamforming methods to improve CRBs. Initial efforts in CAPA-based ISAC have also been reported. For example, a Fourier series expansion-based beamforming approach was proposed to balance the communication signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and sensing SINR in a downlink CAPA-based ISAC system **Liu et al., "Fourier Series Expansion-Based Beamforming for Downlink CAPA-Based ISAC"**.
