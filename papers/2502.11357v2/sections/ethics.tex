The synthetic data collection pipeline proposed in this paper is intended solely for academic research on GUI agents, with strict ethical safeguards to prevent unauthorized website interactions.
To ensure ethical compliance and mitigate risks, we prompt our agents to automatically terminate upon encountering CAPTCHA verifications, login prompts, or payment requests, ensuring that no actual transactions or bookings occur.
Additionally, we filter out websites containing violent or explicit content and strictly adhere to privacy regulations, ensuring that no personal information is used during action execution.
To enforce responsible data collection, we monitor a subset of automatically generated trajectories to ensure compliance with website access policies.
Moreover, we distribute the workload across websites to prevent excessive requests and minimize the impact on any single domain.
