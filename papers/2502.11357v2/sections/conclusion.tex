In this work, we introduce \model, a scalable framework for synthesizing web trajectories on a large scale.
By leveraging thorough web exploration, \model ensures diversity in both domains and the skills acquired by web agents.
Unlike previous approaches, our framework generates contextually grounded trajectories that adapt to real-world constraints, improving both task relevance and generalization.
We instantiate this framework using URLs collected from diverse sources.
\model outperforms existing web agent baselines by a significant margin on both online and offline web agent benchmarks.
Furthermore, our results highlight the critical role of data scale in enhancing web agents' performance.
Future work will focus on extending this framework to encompass a broader range of GUI environments, such as operating systems with diverse applications.
GUI agents require specialized skills for different tasks, including information-seeking, operational, and navigation skills.
Efficient exploration of the environment to acquire these skills presents another promising avenue for future research.
