\model explores the web environment autonomously, which may occasionally result in incoherent tasks.
Synthetic data collection using closed-source LLMs can be costly due to associated API expenses.
While this work serves as a proof of concept, future research will focus on developing tailor-made open-source LLMs for this task.
Additionally, some website content remains inaccessible due to login requirements, leading to insufficient data for those websites.
