The geometry of complex manifolds, in particular Kaehler manifolds, is an important research topic in Differential Geometry. The chapter presents the basic notions and certain important results in complex differential geometry. It defines complex and almost complex manifolds and gives standard examples. Locally, a Kaehlerian metric differs from the Euclidean metric on the complex space Cn starting with the second power of the Taylor series. There are topological obstructions to the existence of Kaehlerian metrics on a compact complex manifold. The differential forms on a Kaehler manifold are studied and the complex version of Hodge theorem is proved in the chapter.}

However, learning disease-relevant cellular environments from these rich imaging data is an open challenge. We developed SPAtial CEllular Graphical Modeling (SPACE-GM), a geometric deep learning framework that flexibly models tumor microenvironments (TMEs) as cellular graphs. We applied SPACE-GM to 658 head-and-neck and colorectal human cancer samples assayed with 40-plex immunofluorescence imaging to identify spatial motifs associated with cancer recurrence and patient survival after immunotherapy. SPACE-GM is substantially more accurate in predicting patient outcomes than previous approaches for modeling spatial data using neighborhood cell-type compositions. Computational interpretation of the disease-relevant microenvironments identified by SPACE-GM generates insights into the effect of spatial dispersion of tumor cells and granulocytes on patient prognosis.Competing Interest StatementSeveral authors are affiliated with Enable Medicine as employees (A.E.T., H.J.K., H.B.D, R.P., and A.T.M.), consultants (Z.W., E.W.), or scientific advisor (J.Z.).},

  abstract = 	 {Simplicial neural network models are becoming popular for processing and analyzing higher-order graph data, but they suffer from high training complexity and dependence on task-specific labels. To address these challenges, we propose simplicial scattering networks (SSNs), a parameter-free model inspired by scattering transforms designed to extract task-agnostic features from simplicial complex data without labels in a principled manner. Specifically, we propose a simplicial scattering transform based on random walk matrices for various adjacencies underlying a simplicial complex. We then use the simplicial scattering transform to construct a deep filter bank network that captures high-frequency information at multiple scales. The proposed simplicial scattering transform possesses properties such as permutation invariance, robustness to perturbations, and expressivity. We theoretically prove that including higher-order information improves the robustness of SSNs to perturbations. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SSNs outperform existing simplicial or graph neural models in many tasks like node classification, simplicial closure, graph classification, trajectory prediction, and simplex prediction while being computationally efficient.}

    abstract = { The concentrations of measure phenomena were discovered as the mathematical background to statistical mechanics at the end of the nineteenth/beginning of the twentieth century and have been explored in mathematics ever since. At the beginning of the twenty-first century, it became clear that the proper utilization of these phenomena in machine learning might transform the curse of dimensionality into the blessing of dimensionality. This paper summarizes recently discovered phenomena of measure concentration which drastically simplify some machine learning problems in high dimension, and allow us to correct legacy artificial intelligence systems. The classical concentration of measure theorems state that i.i.d. random points are concentrated in a thin layer near a surface (a sphere or equators of a sphere, an average or median-level set of energy or another Lipschitz function, etc.). The new stochastic separation theorems describe the thin structure of these thin layers: the random points are not only concentrated in a thin layer but are all linearly separable from the rest of the set, even for exponentially large random sets. The linear functionals for separation of points can be selected in the form of the linear Fisher’s discriminant. All artificial intelligence systems make errors. Non-destructive correction requires separation of the situations (samples) with errors from the samples corresponding to correct behaviour by a simple and robust classifier. The stochastic separation theorems provide us with such classifiers and determine a non-iterative (one-shot) procedure for their construction. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Hilbert’s sixth problem’. }

	abstract = {Background The complexity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) necessitates the application of high-dimensional methods that can spatially resolve the phenotypic heterogeneity that exists within tumors. MIBI, which combines time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) with metal labeled antibodies to simultaneously image 40+ proteins at subcellular spatial resolution, was used to classify cell populations and their expression of immunoregulatory proteins within 54 melanoma samples.Methods A tissue microarray (TMA) comprised of 0.6 mm FFPE melanoma cores was stained with a panel of 30 metal labeled antibodies. The tissue was imaged using MIBI and multi-step processing was performed to create images of the samples. Single cell segmentation enabled enumeration of 32 cell populations and quantitative analyses were performed of both immune checkpoint expression and the spatial relationships between cells of different types.Results Tumor cells and immune cells represented 62\% (1.4\% - 92.2\%) and 24\% (2.0\% - 92.1\%), respectively, of the segmented cells from the melanoma samples. Fibroblasts, lymphatics, and blood vessels were also present at varying densities. Within the immune compartment, M2 macrophages, M2 monocytes, and monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mDCs) were most abundant, representing 36.3\% (4.9\% - 79.3\%), 7.0\% (0.0\% - 30.6\%), and 9.8\% (0.0\% - 34.6\%), respectively, of the total immune cell infiltrate. Rare populations such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells were at greater than 100 cells/mm2 in six samples and four samples, respectively. The presence of immune checkpoint markers (IDO-1, LAG3, PD-1, PD-L1, TIM-3) varied between populations and between samples. A minority of the samples showed expression of IDO-1 and PD-L1 on myeloid populations. Interestingly, among the myeloid subsets, M2 macrophages and monocyte-derived dendritic cells showed the most abundant PD-L1 expression. Although many samples had few T cell infiltrates, those that did showed expression of PD-1, LAG-3, and TIM-3 on T cell populations.Conclusions MIBI offers high-parameter tissue imaging, at sensitivity and resolution suited to understanding the complex tumor immune landscape, including the spatial relationships of immune and tumor cells and the expression of immunoregulatory proteins. Datasets that quantify population densities and immune checkpoint expression levels across tumor samples, such as the present one, can be used to test for associations to clinical variables and further understand the TME at the cellular level.},

abstract = {Summary
Patient-derived organoids (PDOs) can model personalized therapy responses; however, current screening technologies cannot reveal drug response mechanisms or how tumor microenvironment cells alter therapeutic performance. To address this, we developed a highly multiplexed mass cytometry platform to measure post-translational modification (PTM) signaling, DNA damage, cell-cycle activity, and apoptosis in >2,500 colorectal cancer (CRC) PDOs and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in response to clinical therapies at single-cell resolution. To compare patient- and microenvironment-specific drug responses in thousands of single-cell datasets, we developed “Trellis”—a highly scalable, tree-based treatment effect analysis method. Trellis single-cell screening revealed that on-target cell-cycle blockage and DNA-damage drug effects are common, even in chemorefractory PDOs. However, drug-induced apoptosis is rarer, patient-specific, and aligns with cancer cell PTM signaling. We find that CAFs can regulate PDO plasticity—shifting proliferative colonic stem cells (proCSCs) to slow-cycling revival colonic stem cells (revCSCs) to protect cancer cells from chemotherapy.}

  abstract = {As the biomedical community produces datasets that are increasingly complex and high dimensional, there is a need for more sophisticated computational tools to extract biological insights. We present Multiscale PHATE, a method that sweeps through all levels of data granularity to learn abstracted biological features directly predictive of disease outcome. Built on a coarse-graining process called diffusion condensation, Multiscale PHATE learns a data topology that can be analyzed at coarse resolutions for high-level summarizations of data and at fine resolutions for detailed representations of subsets. We apply Multiscale PHATE to a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) dataset with 54 million cells from 168 hospitalized patients and find that patients who die show CD16hiCD66blo neutrophil and IFN-γ+ granzyme B+ Th17 cell responses. We also show that population groupings from Multiscale PHATE directly fed into a classifier predict disease outcome more accurately than naive featurizations of the data. Multiscale PHATE is broadly generalizable to different data types, including flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), single-cell sequencing assay for transposase-accessible chromatin (scATAC-seq), and clinical variables.},

abstract = {Single cell genomics has revolutionized our ability to map immune heterogeneity and responses. With the influx of large-scale data sets from diverse modalities, the resolution achieved has supported the long-held notion that immune cells are naturally organized into hierarchical relationships, characterized at multiple levels. Such a multigranular structure corresponds to key geometric and topological features. Given that differences between an effective and ineffective immunological response may not be found at one level, there is vested interest in characterizing and predicting outcomes from such features. In this review, we highlight single cell methods and principles for learning geometric and topological properties of data at multiple scales, discussing their contributions to immunology. Ultimately, multiscale approaches go beyond classical clustering, revealing a more comprehensive picture of cellular heterogeneity.}

It is one of the first examples of extending convolutional neural network-like operators to general manifolds. The initial work on this model focused primarily on its theoretical stability and invariance properties but did  not provide methods for its numerical implementation except in the case of two-dimensional surfaces with predefined meshes. In this work, we present practical schemes,  based on the theory of diffusion maps, for implementing the manifold scattering transform to datasets arising in naturalistic systems, such as single cell genetics, where the data is a high-dimensional point cloud modeled as lying on a low-dimensional manifold. We show that our methods are effective for signal classification and manifold classification tasks.}

abstract={Identifying gene expression differences in heterogeneous tissues across conditions is a fundamental biological task, enabled by multi-condition single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). Current data analysis approaches divide the constituent cells into clusters meant to represent cell types, but such discrete categorization tends to be an unsatisfactory model of the underlying biology. Here, we introduce latent embedding multivariate regression (LEMUR), a model that operates without, or before, commitment to discrete categorization. LEMUR (1) integrates data from different conditions, (2) predicts each cell's gene expression changes as a function of the conditions and its position in latent space and (3) for each gene, identifies a compact neighborhood of cells with consistent differential expression. We apply LEMUR to cancer, zebrafish development and spatial gradients in Alzheimer's disease, demonstrating its broad applicability.},

abstract={High-dimensional cytometry (HDC) is a powerful technology for studying single-cell phenotypes in complex biological systems. Although technological developments and affordability have made HDC broadly available in recent years, technological advances were not coupled with an adequate development of analytical methods that can take full advantage of the complex data generated. While several analytical platforms and bioinformatics tools have become available for the analysis of HDC data, these are either web-hosted with limited scalability or designed for expert computational biologists, making their use unapproachable for wet lab scientists. Additionally, end-to-end HDC data analysis is further hampered due to missing unified analytical ecosystems, requiring researchers to navigate multiple platforms and software packages to complete the analysis. To bridge this data analysis gap in HDC we develop cyCONDOR, an easy-to-use computational framework covering not only all essential steps of cytometry data analysis but also including an array of downstream functions and tools to expand the biological interpretation of the data. The comprehensive suite of features of cyCONDOR, including guided pre-processing, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and machine learning algorithms, facilitates the seamless integration of cyCONDOR into clinically relevant settings, where scalability and disease classification are paramount for the widespread adoption of HDC in clinical practice. Additionally, the advanced analytical features of cyCONDOR, such as pseudotime analysis and batch integration, provide researchers with the tools to extract deeper insights from their data. We use cyCONDOR on a variety of data from different tissues and technologies demonstrating its versatility to assist the analysis of high-dimensional data from preprocessing to biological interpretation.},
