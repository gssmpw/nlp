\label{sec:conslusion}
% This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of generation-refinement frameworks for mitigating sequential dependencies in autoregressive models, highlighting their impact on efficient neural sequence generation across text, speech, and visual domains. By examining both algorithmic innovations and system-level implementations, we demonstrate their broad applicability and provide crucial deployment insights. Moving forward, key challenges remain in building solid theoretical foundations to balance parallelism and quality, developing cross-modal approaches, and scaling speculative decoding as the number of draft and target models increases, particularly in large-scale LLM systems.
This survey analyzes generation-refinement frameworks for mitigating sequential dependencies in autoregressive models, highlighting how these approaches are fundamentally changing efficient neural sequence generation across text, speech, and visual domains. Through examining both algorithmic innovations and system-level implementations, we have demonstrated their broad applicability while providing crucial deployment insights for practitioners. Moving forward, significant challenges persist in constructing solid theoretical foundations to grasp the balance between parallelism and quality, as well as in developing comprehensive approaches that span different modalities—efforts that could narrow the divide between the capabilities of large models and their actual implementation. Additionally, it remains crucial to examine the scalability of the speculative decoding system as the quantity of draft and target models increases.
