\section*{Limitations}
While this survey provides a comprehensive overview of generation-refinement frameworks, some limitations should be acknowledged. Detailed performance comparisons across different approaches are challenging due to varying experimental settings, model architectures, and hardware configurations used in the original papers. The lack of standardized benchmarks for speculative decoding makes it difficult to make definitive claims about the relative efficiency of different methods. Additionally, while we examine applications across different modalities, our analysis may not fully capture all domain-specific challenges and optimizations, particularly for emerging areas like video generation and multimodal reasoning.
