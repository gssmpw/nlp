    \caption{The overview of our proposed Iterative Preference Optimization framework. IPO consists of three major parts: (a) Human Preference Dataset. It is used to train a critic model. This dataset only requires one-round manual annotation without need of relabeling in the iterative framework; (b) Critic Model. It is learned to automatically annotate generated videos with preference labels, which help eliminate tedious manual efforts for multi-round optimization; (c) Iterative Optimization. It incorporates the critical model to iteratively optimize video foundation model. In this way, IPO can efficiently tune the base model to align with human preference and enhance generation ability in aspects of subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. \textbf{Best viewed in 2x zoom}.
