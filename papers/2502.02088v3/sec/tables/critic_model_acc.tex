    \caption{Accuracy of Critic Models on Validation Sets Across Different Scales.
    The critic models used in this study are finetuned from the ViLA\cite{lin2023vila} multimodal large language model. This table evaluates their performance at different scales (13B and 40B) in terms of accuracy on pairwise and pointwise validation datasets. The results demonstrate that larger model scales yield higher accuracy for both pairwise ranking and pointwise scoring, indicating improved alignment with human preferences as the model size increases.}
