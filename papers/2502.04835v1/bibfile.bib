abstract = {Code examples are an important source for answering questions about software libraries and applications. Many usage contexts for code examples require them to be distilled to their essence: e.g., when serving as cues to longer documents, or for reminding developers of a previously known idiom. We conducted a study to discover how code can be summarized and why. As part of the study, we collected 156 pairs of code examples and their summaries from 16 participants, along with over 26 hours of think-aloud verbalizations detailing the decisions of the participants during their summarization activities. Based on a qualitative analysis of this data we elicited a list of practices followed by the participants to summarize code examples and propose empirically-supported hypotheses justifying the use of specific practices. One main finding was that none of the participants exclusively extracted code verbatim for the summaries, motivating abstractive summarization. The results provide a grounded basis for the development of code example summarization and presentation technology.},

abstract = {Quantifying the coherence of a set of statements is a long standing problem with many potential applications that has attracted researchers from different sciences. The special case of measuring coherence of topics has been recently studied to remedy the problem that topic models give no guaranty on the interpretablity of their output. Several benchmark datasets were produced that record human judgements of the interpretability of topics. We are the first to propose a framework that allows to construct existing word based coherence measures as well as new ones by combining elementary components. We conduct a systematic search of the space of coherence measures using all publicly available topic relevance data for the evaluation. Our results show that new combinations of components outperform existing measures with respect to correlation to human ratings. nFinally, we outline how our results can be transferred to further applications in the context of text mining, information retrieval and the world wide web.},

abstract = {Research in program comprehension has evolved considerably over the past decades. However, only little is known about how developers practice program comprehension in their daily work. This article reports on qualitative and quantitative research to comprehend the strategies, tools, and knowledge used for program comprehension. We observed 28 professional developers, focusing on their comprehension behavior, strategies followed, and tools used. In an online survey with 1,477 respondents, we analyzed the importance of certain types of knowledge for comprehension and where developers typically access and share this knowledge.We found that developers follow pragmatic comprehension strategies depending on context. They try to avoid comprehension whenever possible and often put themselves in the role of users by inspecting graphical interfaces. Participants confirmed that standards, experience, and personal communication facilitate comprehension. The team size, its distribution, and open-source experience influence their knowledge sharing and access behavior. While face-to-face communication is preferred for accessing knowledge, knowledge is frequently shared in informal comments.Our results reveal a gap between research and practice, as we did not observe any use of comprehension tools and developers seem to be unaware of them. Overall, our findings call for reconsidering the research agendas towards context-aware tool support.},
