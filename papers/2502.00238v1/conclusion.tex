\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Identifying and mitigating defeaters in software assurance cases is increasingly being adopted to increase the robustness of, and confidence in, assurance cases in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. Potential obstacles to an assurance case's claim that its safety requirements are satisfied may cast doubt on the validity and trustworthiness of the case. 
There have been growing calls to develop a framework to standardize defeater analysis. 
In this work, we argue that to facilitate this in research and practice, it is essential to develop a consolidated taxonomy of real-world defeaters. Through a review and 
%reflexive 
thematic analysis of publicly available safety assurance cases, we provide and evaluate a proposed taxonomy of defeaters as an initial guide. 
Validation of the taxonomy with user studies is left to future work.
Our work offers a necessary step for standardizing defeater analysis in assurance cases toward improving the overall robustness of safety-critical systems. We expect and hope that the defeater taxonomy presented here will evolve as research and community engagement progress.
