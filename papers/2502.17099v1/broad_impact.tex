\section*{Broader Impact and Limitations}
The ethical considerations of DPM generally apply to our method. Similar to other generative models, DPM has the potential to produce damaging fake content. Additionally, the proposed adversarial training (AT) could further enhance the detrimental effects of DPM when exploited for malicious purposes. Our work solves DRO with adversarial training which can be further improved if a more accurate and efficient DRO algorithm can be found.
