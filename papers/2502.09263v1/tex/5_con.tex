\section{Conclusion}
% This study demonstrates that classic GNNs, when enhanced with our GNN$^+$ framework, can match and even surpass GTs on graph-level tasks. Across 14 benchmark datasets, these upgraded GNNs consistently rank in the top three, achieving first place in eight while also exhibiting greater efficiency. Our findings challenge the prevailing assumption that GTs inherently outperform GNNs and reaffirm the potential of well-structured GNNs as a powerful model. 
% We hope that our findings encourage more rigorous empirical evaluations in the field of graph machine learning.

%This study highlights the often-overlooked potential of classic GNNs. By integrating six widely used techniques into a unified GNN$^+$ framework, we enhance 3 classic GNNs for graph-level tasks. Evaluations on 14 benchmark datasets show that, these enhanced GNNs consistently rank among the top three and secure first place on eight, while also exhibiting greater efficiency. These findings challenge the prevailing belief that GTs are inherently superior, reaffirming that well-designed GNNs remain highly competitive.

Evaluations on 14 benchmark datasets reveal that, these enhanced GNNs match or outperform GTs, while also demonstrating greater efficiency. These findings challenge the prevailing belief that GTs are inherently superior, reaffirming the capability of simple GNN structures as powerful models.
