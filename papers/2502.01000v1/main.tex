\begin{abstract}
Recent advances in foundation models have brought promising results in computer vision, including medical image segmentation.
Fine-tuning foundation models on specific low-resource medical tasks has become a standard practice.
However, ensuring reliable and robust model adaptation when the target task has a large domain gap and few annotated samples remains a challenge. 
Previous few-shot domain adaptation (FSDA) methods seek to bridge the distribution gap between source and target domains by utilizing auxiliary data.
The selection and scheduling of auxiliaries are often based on heuristics, which can easily cause negative transfer.  
In this work, we propose an Active and Sequential domain AdaPtation (ASAP) framework for dynamic auxiliary dataset selection in FSDA.
We formulate FSDA as a multi-armed bandit problem and derive an efficient reward function to prioritize training on auxiliary datasets that align closely with the target task, through a single-round fine-tuning.
Empirical validation on diverse medical segmentation datasets demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art FSDA methods. %achieving an average gain of 27.75\% on MRI and 7.52\% on CT datasets in Dice score.

\label{sec:ethics}

% IEEE-ISBI supports the standard requirements on the use of animal and
% human subjects for scientific and biomedical research. For all IEEE
% ISBI papers reporting data from studies involving human and/or
% animal subjects, formal review and approval, or formal review and
% waiver, by an appropriate institutional review board or ethics
% committee is required and should be stated in the papers. For those
% investigators whose Institutions do not have formal ethics review
% committees, the principles  outlined in the Helsinki Declaration of
% 1975, as revised in 2000, should be followed.

% Reporting on compliance with ethical standards is required
% (irrespective of whether ethical approval was needed for the study) in
% the paper. Authors are responsible for correctness of the statements
% provided in the manuscript. Examples of appropriate statements
% include:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item ``This is a numerical simulation study for which no ethical
%     approval was required.'' 
%   \item ``This research study was conducted retrospectively using
%     human subject data made available in open access by (Source
%     information). Ethical approval was not required as confirmed by
%     the license attached with the open access data.''
%     \item ``This study was performed in line with the principles of
%       the Declaration of Helsinki. Approval was granted by the Ethics
%       Committee of University B (Date.../No. ...).''
% \end{itemize}
This research study was conducted retrospectively using the animal subject data made available in open access by %\cite{pati2021federated,reina2021openfl,baid2021rsna,sun2021multi,kuijf2019standardized}
\cite{pati2021federated,sun2021multi,kuijf2019standardized,wasserthal2023totalsegmentator,antonelli2022medical}.
Ethical approval was not required as confirmed by the license attached with the open access data.
