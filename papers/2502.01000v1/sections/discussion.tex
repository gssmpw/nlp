\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-0.3cm}
We propose a novel active and sequential domain adaptation (ASAP) framework to adapt foundation models for the few-shot medical image segmentation tasks. 
% while exploring and exploiting the auxiliary data.
With our desiderata in mind, the proposed ASAP achieve:
1) no requirement for access to the source domain or a substantial amount of target data,
%, whether labeled or unlabeled,
2) incorporation of auxiliary data with dynamic scheduling of prioritized learning, adding minimal extra memory and computational overhead,
3) effective and efficient adaptation of foundational models, leading to strong performance on the target task.
% The results of experiments on three benchmark medical datasets show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in foundation model adaptation problems within the realm of medical image processing. 
We believe our proposed approach will better leverage public medical resources, including foundation models and available auxiliary datasets, to tailor a model for the desired few-shot target task in a fast and scalable way.
