\section{Conclusion}
% \vspace{-0.035in}
We identified a new opportunity for optimizing the evaluation of an evolving graph query over large number of snapshots. We showed that a large fraction of vertices whose query results do not change can be identified and computed once for all snapshots and exploited to minimize incremental computations performed concurrently for all snapshots. %over a much smaller graph. 
%Our approach substantially outperforms state of the art incremental approaches.
