\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed an unifying framework for confounded IL with hidden confounders that unifies and extends previous confounded IL settings. Specifically, we considered hidden confounders to be partially observable to the expert, and demonstrated that causal IL under this framework can be reduced to a set of CMRs with the trajectory histories as instruments. We proposed DML-IL, a novel algorithm to solve these CMRs and learn an imitator. We provided bounds on the imitation gap for the learnt imitator. Finally, we empirically evaluated DML-IL on multiple tasks including Mujoco environments and demonstrated state-of-the-art performance against other causal IL algorithms.
