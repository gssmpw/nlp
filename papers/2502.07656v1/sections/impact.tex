% \section*{Impact Statement}
% The goal of this paper is to propose a methodology for imitating expert policies from confounded offline data. Our work has broad applications in automated decision-making, including areas such as planning, healthcare, and finance. Theoretical guarantees provided in this study ensure the reliability and bounded suboptimality of the learned policies. While we do not anticipate negative implications from our methodology, we emphasize the importance of incorporating human oversight and conducting thorough validation in new settings to mitigate risks of misapplication.
