\section{Conclusion}
Under evasion attacks, most existing methods rely on priors to enhance robustness, which limits their effectiveness.  
To address this, we propose a novel framework named \ModelName, which achieves prior-free structure purification across diverse evasion attacks and datasets.
\ModelName\ innovatively adopts the graph diffusion model to learn the clean graph distribution and purify the attacked graph under the direction of captured predictive patterns.
To precisely denoise the attacked graph without disrupting the clean structure, we design an LID-Driven Non-Isotropic Diffusion Mechanism to inject varying levels of noise into each node based on their adversarial degree. To align the semantic information between the generated graph and the target clean graph, we design a Graph Transfer Entropy Guided Denoising Mechanism to reduce generation uncertainty and guide the generation direction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that \ModelName~ enhances
the robustness of graph learning in various scenarios.
In future work, we aim to incorporate feature-based attack experiments and optimize the time complexity of \ModelName. Additionally, we plan to improve our proposed graph entropy tool and explore its application. Details about the limitations and future directions can be found in Appendix~\ref{appendix:future}.
