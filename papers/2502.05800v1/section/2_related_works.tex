\section{Related Work}

Several lightweight models have been created to address the computational challenges of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in resource-constrained settings. Notable examples include MobileViT \cite{mehta2021mobilevit}, FastViT \cite{vasu2023fastvit}, and EfficientFormerV2 \cite{li2023rethinking}. These models integrate convolutional units from MobileNetV2 \cite{sandler2018mobilenetv2} or MobileOne \cite{vasu2023mobileone} with Transformer architectures. They employ spatially efficient convolutions in the initial stages to minimize computational cost, while Transformer layers handle long-range dependencies, achieving strong image classification performance on edge and mobile devices.

Efficient self-attention (SA) mechanisms are crucial for ViT scalability. MobileViTv2 \cite{mehta2022separable} employs Separable Linear Attention to separate spatial and channel interactions, reducing computational load, and enhancing edge computing efficiency. Similarly, EdgeNeXt \cite{maaz2022edgenext} applies transposed SA to boost performance on low-power devices, preserving accuracy. Additionally, SHViT (Single-Head Vision Transformer) \cite{yun2024shvit} streamlines attention by substituting the traditional MHSA with a single head, cutting redundant feature extraction and computational complexity while maintaining accuracy.

However, there remains a gap in the literature concerning holistic approaches that simultaneously address computational efficiency, feature redundancy, and power consumption. Our proposed MicroViT aims to bridge this gap by offering a lightweight Vision Transformer architecture optimized for both
performance and power efficiency in edge device deployments.
