\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
This review examines the evolution of vision-based power line inspection through deep learning technologies. We explored various imaging platforms and techniques, from UAVs to X-Ray imaging, analyzing their effectiveness for different inspection tasks. The review detailed how deep learning algorithms like YOLO, R-CNN, and SSD have advanced component detection and fault diagnosis, with particular success in insulator inspection. Current trends show promising developments in edge-cloud fusion architectures and two-stage detection approaches, balancing computational efficiency with accuracy. However, challenges persist in data availability, annotation efficiency and unknown defect detection among others. Solutions are emerging through synthetic data generation, few-shot learning, and semi-automatic labeling techniques. Looking forward, the integration of edge-cloud computing, multi-modal fusion, and novel learning approaches suggests a trajectory toward more resilient and adaptive power line maintenance systems. These advancements promise to enhance the reliability and efficiency of power infrastructure inspection while reducing operational costs and safety risks.
