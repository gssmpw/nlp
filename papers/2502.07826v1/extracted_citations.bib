	abstract = {The widespread popularity of unmanned aerial vehicles enables an immense amount of power line inspection data to be collected. It is an urgent issue to employ massive data especially the visible images to maintain the reliability, safety, and sustainability of power transmission. To date, substantial works have been conducted on the data analysis for power line inspection. With the aim of providing a comprehensive overview for researchers interested in developing a deep-learning-based analysis system for power line inspection data, this paper conducts a thorough review of the current literature and identifies the challenges for future study. Following the typical procedure of data analysis in power line inspection, current works in this area are categorized into component detection and fault diagnosis. For each aspect, the techniques and methodologies adopted in the literature are summarized. Valuable information is also included such as data description and method performance. In particular, an in-depth discussion of existing deep-learning-based analysis methods of power line inspection data is proposed. To conclude the paper, several study trends for the future in this area are presented including data quality problems, small object detection, embedded application, and evaluation baseline.},

	abstract = {To maintain the reliability, availability, and sustainability of electricity supply, electricity companies regularly perform visual inspections on their transmission and distribution networks. These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges. Finally, we conclude the paper with an outlook for the future of this field and propose potential next steps for implementing the concept.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system that uses unmanned aerial vehicle inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of the data analysis. To facilitate the implementation of the system, we address three main challenges of deep learning in vision-based power line inspection: (i) the lack of training data; (ii) class imbalance; and (iii) the detection of small components and faults. First, we create four medium-sized datasets for training component detection and classification models. Furthermore, we apply a series of effective data augmentation techniques to balance out the imbalanced classes. Finally, we propose the multi-stage component detection and classification based on the Single Shot Multibox detector and deep Residual Networks to detect small components and faults. The results show that the proposed system is fast and accurate in detecting common faults on power line components, including missing top caps, cracks in poles and cross arms, woodpecker damage on poles, and rot damage on cross arms. The field tests suggest that our system has a promising role in the intelligent monitoring and inspection of power line components and as a valuable addition to smart grids.},
