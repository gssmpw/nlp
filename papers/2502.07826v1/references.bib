The aging diagnosis problem of conductor morphology is transformed into a multiclassification problem. The proposed model is improved via a weakly labeled training dataset and a designed loss function (combination of entropy loss, cross-entropy loss, and Kullback–Leibler divergence loss). Compared with four frequently used CNN-based classifiers, the proposed classifier on the collected dataset achieves a better performance. In addition, the influence of parameters and types of label distribution on classification accuracy is also investigated. Here, a promising technique is presented for the aging estimation of aged conductor with high accuracy when the images of conductor surface are available.},

In recent years, deep learning methods have achieved remarkable results in image classification and object detection. However, in the power line inspection based on computer vision, datasets have a significant impact on deep learning. The lack of public high-quality power scene data hinders the application of deep learning. To address this problem, we built a dataset for power line inspection scenes, named RSIn-Dataset. RSIn-Dataset contains 4 categories and 1887 images, with abundant backgrounds. Then, we used mainstream object detection methods to build a benchmark, providing reference for insulator detection. In addition, to address the problem of detection inefficiency caused by large model parameters, an improved YoloV4 is proposed, named YoloV4++. It uses a lightweight network, i.e., MobileNetv1, as the backbone, and employs the depthwise separable convolution to replace the standard convolution. Meanwhile, the focal loss is implemented in the loss function to solve the impact of sample imbalance. The experimental results show the effectiveness of YoloV4++. The mAP and FPS can reach 94.24\% and 53.82 FPS, respectively.},

	abstract = {Contamination on insulators may increase the surface conductivity of the insulator, and as a consequence, electrical discharges occur more frequently, which can lead to interruptions in a power supply. To maintain reliability in an electrical distribution power system, components that have lost their insulating properties must be replaced. Identifying the components that need maintenance is a difficult task as there are several levels of contamination that are hard to notice during inspections. To improve the quality of inspections, this paper proposes using k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) to classify the levels of insulator contamination based on images of insulators at various levels of contamination simulated in the laboratory. Computer vision features such as mean, variance, asymmetry, kurtosis, energy, and entropy are used for training the k-NN. To assess the robustness of the proposed approach, a statistical analysis and a comparative assessment with well-consolidated algorithms such as decision tree, ensemble subspace, and support vector machine models are presented. The k-NN showed up to 85.17\% accuracy using the k-fold cross-validation method, with an average accuracy higher than 82\% for the multi-classification of contamination of insulators, being superior to the compared models.},

In this paper, it is proposed to use segmentation and edge detection techniques to increase the database, making classification possible using the Inception v3 deep neural network model. From a pre-processing using the Gaussian filter to smooth the image, the techniques of the threshold with binarization, adaptive binarization, and Otsu and riddler-calvard are used for segmentation; and for edge detection, the sobel and canny techniques are used.

When contamination accumulates in the structures of the network, there may be shutdowns caused by electrical arcs. To improve the reliability of the network, visual inspections of the electrical power system can be carried out; these inspections can be automated using computer vision techniques based on deep neural networks. Based on this need, this paper proposes the Semi-ProtoPNet deep learning model to classify defective structures in the power distribution networks. The Semi-ProtoPNet deep neural network does not perform convex optimization of its last dense layer to maintain the impact of the negative reasoning process on image classification. The negative reasoning process rejects the incorrect classes of an input image; for this reason, it is possible to carry out an analysis with a low number of images that have different backgrounds, which is one of the challenges of this type of analysis. Semi-ProtoPNet achieves an accuracy of 97.22\%, being superior to VGG-13, VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet-34, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DenseNet-121, DenseNet-161, DenseNet-201, and also models of the same class such as ProtoPNet, NP-ProtoPNet, Gen-ProtoPNet, and Ps-ProtoPNet.},

Most existing methods detect insulators by rectangular bounding box but do not perform segmentation down to instance pixel-level. In this paper, we propose an automated end-to-end framework enabled by attention mechanism to enhance recognition of defective insulators. Using natural industry dataset of images acquired by unmanned aerial vehicle, pixel-level recognition is formulated into two computer vision tasks; object detection and instance segmentation. We increase the capabilities of our chosen model by leveraging a light-weight but effective three-branch attention structure integrated into the backbone network as an add-on module. Specifically, we exploit cross-dimensional interactions to build an efficient computation of attention weights across channels of the backbone network to achieve gains in detection performance for defective insulators up to about + 2.0 points compared to our base model, at negligible overhead cost. Our proposed model reaches comparable levels with a more recent state of the art instance mask prediction model.},

Regular inspection using computer vision technology is an effective way to detect insulator defects and improve the catenary operation safety. However, achieving full automation of insulator defects detection is still a difficult task due to the defective sample scarcity and subtle defect features. To overcome the problem, this article proposes defect detection GANs (DefGANs) that consist of a denoising autoencoder, a discriminator, and a classifier to detect defects, which can generate defective samples from pitted latent representations, thereby improving the reliability of defect detection classifier. The proposed DefGAN can pit the latent representations of normal samples to generate defective samples. Our proposal mainly consists of two stages. In the first stage, we use cascaded deep segmentation networks (CDSNets) to extract the insulator from the catenary images. Then, the insulator area is sampled into small patches. In the second stage, the patches are fed into the proposed DefGAN to detect defects. Moreover, the defect score is determined by the anomaly probability of the classifier and reconstruction error of the denoising autoencoder. The effectiveness of our work is measured across the catenary data sets.},

	abstract = {The inspection of insulator faults is an important task to prevent catastrophic failures in the operation of an electric substation. Manual inspection of overhead power line insulators can be very dangerous owning to the presence of high voltage in power sub-stations. Hence, in this paper, we present an infrared thermal (IRT) camera based non-invasive computer vision system for automatic monitoring and visual inspection of overhead on line power insulators. In the proposed work, initially, an optimal threshold method is applied to segment the region of interest (ROI) in IRT images. Subsequently, various geometrical, morphological, intensity and statistical features are computed from the segmented ROI, which are eventually utilized as an input to Gaussian kernel support vector machine to classify the different type of faults in insulator images. Computer vision based automatic inspection of insulators can play an important role from environment as well as human safety point of view. Timely inspection of insulators can ensure the environmental safety through prevention of fire that may be caused due to the insulator failures leading to the sudden breakdown of high-power lines. The proposed system achieved the true positive rate (TPR), and false negative rate (FNR) of 97.3\%, and 2.66\%, respectively. Whereas, the system obtained the Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and False Discovery Rates (FDR) of about 97\% and 3\%, respectively with the accuracy of 0.97 on the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. The performance of the proposed method is compared with other existing state of the art methods and found that our method outperformed over them. Hence, we recommend proposed system to detect the severity of faults in IRT images long before any catastrophic failures take place at power sub-stations.},

	abstract = {The insulator is an important catenary component that maintains the insulation between the catenary and earth. Due to the long-term impact of railway vehicles and the environment, defects in the insulator are inevitable. Recently, automatic catenary inspection using computer vision and pattern recognition has been introduced to improve the safety of railway operation. However, achieving full automation of insulator defect detection is still very challenging due to the visual complexity of defects and the small number of defective insulators. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel insulator surface defect detection system using a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed system consists of two stages. First, a Faster R-CNN network is adopted to localize the key catenary components, and the image areas that contain the insulators are obtained. Then, the classification score and anomaly score are determined from a deep multitask neural network that is composed of a deep material classifier and a deep denoising autoencoder. The defect state is determined by analyzing the classification score and anomaly score. Experiments of the catenary insulator defect detection along the Hefei-Fuzhou high-speed railway line indicate that the system can achieve high detection accuracy.},

Catenary system malfunction could interrupt railway service and threaten public safety. This article presents a computer vision algorithm that is developed to automatically detect the defective rod-insulators in a catenary system to ensure reliable power transmission. Two key challenges in building such a robust inspection system are addressed in this work, the detection of the insulators in the catenary image and the detection of possible defects. A two-step insulator detection method is implemented to detect insulators with different inclination angles in the image. The sub-images containing cantilevers and rods are first extracted from the catenary image. Then, the insulators are detected in the sub-image using deformable part models. A local intensity period estimation algorithm is designed specifically for insulator defect detection. Experimental results show that the proposed method is able to automatically and reliably detect insulator defects including the breakage of the ceramic discs and the foreign objects clamped between two ceramic discs. The performance of this visual inspection method meets the strict requirements for catenary system maintenance.},

	abstract = {Electricity networks are critical infrastructure, delivering vital energy services. Due to the significant number, variety and distribution of electrical network overhead line assets, energy network operators spend millions annually on inspection and maintenance programmes. Currently, inspection involves acquiring and manually analysing aerial images. This is labour intensive and subjective. Along with costs associated with helicopter or drone operations, data analysis represents a significant financial burden to network operators. We propose an approach to automating assessment of the condition of electrical towers. Importantly, we train machine learning tower classifiers without using condition labels for individual components of interest. Instead, learning is supervised using only condition labels for towers in their entirety. This enables us to use a real-world industry dataset without needing costly additional human labelling of thousands of individual components. Our prototype first detects instances of components in multiple images of each tower, using Mask R-CNN or RetinaNet. It then predicts tower condition ratings using one of two approaches: (i) component instance classifiers trained using class labels transferred from towers to each of their detected component instances, or (ii) multiple instance learning classifiers based on bags of detected instances. Instance or bag class predictions are aggregated to obtain tower condition ratings. Evaluation used a dataset with representative tower images and associated condition ratings covering a range of component types, scenes, environmental conditions, and viewpoints. We report experiments investigating classification of towers based on the condition of their multiple insulator and U-bolt components. Insulators and their U-bolts were detected with average precision of 96.7 and 97.9, respectively. Tower classification achieved areas under ROC curves of 0.94 and 0.98 for insulator condition and U-bolt condition ratings, respectively. Thus we demonstrate that tower condition classifiers can be trained effectively without labelling the condition of individual components.},

These inspections have been typically carried out using foot patrol and/or helicopter-assisted methods to plan for necessary repair or replacement works before any major damage, which may cause power outage. This solution is quite slow, expensive, and potentially dangerous. In recent years, numerous researches have been conducted to automate the visual inspections by using automated helicopters, flying robots, and/or climbing robots. However, due to the high accuracy requirements of the task and its unique challenges, automatic vision-based inspection has not been widely adopted. In this paper, with the aim of providing a good starting point for researchers who are interested in developing a fully automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection system, we conduct an extensive literature review. First, we examine existing power line inspection methods with special attention paid to highlight their advantages and disadvantages. Next, we summarize well-suited tasks and review potential data sources for automatic vision-based inspection. Then, we survey existing automatic vision-based power line inspection systems. Based on that, we propose a new automatic autonomous vision-based power line inspection concept that uses Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) inspection as the main inspection method, optical images as the primary data source, and deep learning as the backbone of data analysis and inspection. Then, we present an overview of possibilities and challenges of deep vision (deep learning for computer vision) approaches for both UAV navigation and UAV inspection and discuss possible solutions to the challenges.

The first one presents information about datasets used in machine learning, especially deep learning.

Metal dampers, a crucial protective fitting in the line, can effectively suppress the conductor’s vibration energy and prevent Aeolian vibration and ice shedding. To ensure the safety of operation of the damper, we are proposing a detection method for structural defect damper based on spatial relationship. First, the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial damper images are processed with relative total variation (RTV) transform to obtain an enhanced image with a smooth texture and prominent foreground main structure. Second, the enhanced image is corrected by rotation so that the conductor remains horizontal. Next, based on the endpoint coordinates of the conductor, a foreground preselection box for improved GrabCut segmentation is automatically generated to extract the object dampers. Finally, the spatial relationship between the damper components in the segmentation results is regarded as the motive force of the damper structural defect diagnosis model to detect damage, inversion, slight, and serious deformation defects in sequence. We analyzed the performance of the proposed method through actual field tests, and the results demonstrated that the identification accuracy of the method is 95.76\% when applied to a small sample set, which is higher than other existing methods based on traditional image techniques and deep learning defect detection, and can effectively identify different structural defects of dampers and provide reliable data for transmission line condition monitoring.},

This is because it is difficult for drone pilots to recognize power lines at long distances, even on sunny days, and power lines are less visible in rainy or foggy weather. Therefore, power line detection is necessary for safe drone flight. This article proposes an algorithm that can recognize various shapes and locations of multiple power lines while improving the recognition performance of power lines compared to previous studies. YOLO, a deep learning technology used for object detection, is used to recognize power lines as multiple bounding boxes, and center points of these bounding boxes are sorted and integrated. This algorithm improves the power line detection performance by excluding incorrectly detected power lines and restoring undetected parts of the power lines. The performance of the proposed method was evaluated using the intersection-over-union (IoU) and F1-score, which were 0.674 and 0.528, respectively. This performance was superior to those of U-Net, LaneNet and BiSeNet V2 which are deep learning technologies for segmentation. The proposed method was mounted on the embedded system of the test drone, and tests were conducted indoor and outdoor. Then, the average frames per second (FPS) value was calculated as 10.05. Various shapes and locations of multiple power lines can be recognized in real-time using the power line recognition method proposed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Power line parts detection refers to the inspection of key parts on transmission lines against the complex background in aerial images and identifying whether exist anomalies that cause transmission failure. Obviously, this process plays a pivotal role in ensuring the safety of power transmission. Most of the existing methods are based on deep convolutional neural networks. However, the complexity and variability of the aerial image background and the problem of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) shooting perspective and distance pose a challenge for previous works. This study aims to improve the detection accuracy of the model and propose an attention-guided multitask convolutional neural network (AGMNet). First, to enhance the feature representation of objects in aerial images, we construct spatial region attention blocks that are suitable for object detection. It can be inserted into any existing convolutional backbone network. Due to its efficient feature tensor computation method, the network can obtain competitive results with less computational memory. Second, we introduce a multitask framework that creatively considers the identification of rust levels and abnormal conditions of power line components, which has not been considered in previous works. Finally, we incorporate the refinable region proposal network (RPN) structure and multiscale training strategy to improve the robustness of the network. The experimental results on the testing datasets show that the proposed AGMNet can recognize the power parts (dampers and suspension clamps) with a mean average precision (mAP) of 95.3\% and simultaneously identify their rust levels with an mAP of 75.4\% and abnormal conditions with an mAP of 92.7\%.},

	abstract = {Automatic power transmission line detection plays the key role in smart grid which has been widely applied into the path planning and navigation of intelligent inspection platforms, such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), climbing robots, hybrid inspection robots, etc. Nevertheless, the power lines are always against complex background environment and different illumination conditions. And the power lines occupy a minimal portion image pixels in the aerial images compared with backgrounds which causes the foreground-background class imbalance issue. Therefore, robust and accurate vision-based power line detection still faces a certain challenge. Recently, deep learning has got fast development on pixel-level object segmentation due to strong contextual feature expression ability, especially U-shape network (U-Net) and its variants. However, it still exists a certain shortcomings owing to insufficient process of local contextual features to affect the segmentation precision. Meanwhile, multiple pooling operations in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) also will cause the information loss. To address these issues, with the encoder-decoder architecture, a novel vision-based power line detection network is proposed in this paper to construct an end-to-end detection scheme of power lines from aerial images. To make the segmentation network capture the global contexts and emphasize target regions of power transmission lines, an attention block is proposed to be embedded into the proposed power line detection network to address the class imbalance issue. Meanwhile, faced with the insufficient process of local contextual feature maps of DCNNs, an attention fusion block is proposed for multi-scale feature fusion to acquire more rich information and improve the segmentation precision. Experiments on power lines show that the proposed power line detection network shows a good segmentation performance on real power line environment compared with other advanced detection methods.},

	abstract = {The accurate extraction of transmission lines from unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) aerial photography is a necessary but challenging task for intelligent power inspection due to some factors, such as complex backgrounds, varying illumination, and class-imbalance issue. Although there have been some research achievements in transmission line extraction, especially U-Net and its variant networks, there are still some shortcomings, such as insufficiency processing of local features, limited noise denoising ability, and poor edge feature representation ability. In this article, we propose a dual-branch residual attention network, called DRA-Net, which introduces a dual-branch encoder composed of a residual convolutional neural network (RCNN) branch and a recurrent RCNN (RRCNN) branch to extract richer semantic information and a context fusion block (CFB) to fuse temporal and spatial information effectively. In addition, a U-shaped noise denoising (UND) block is proposed to reduce interference from complex backgrounds and an edge enhancement block (EEB) is also proposed to strength the capacity of segmentation network to extract useful edge feature information from noise. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRA-Net has obtained an excellent segmentation manifestation on remote sensing images, with a 93.26\% Dice coefficient and 93.19\% mIoU value on the public power line dataset (PLD), and a 96.40\% Dice coefficient and 96.04\% mIoU value on the self-built overhead power line (OPL) dataset.},

Finally, this paper compares the improved YOLOv7 algorithm with other YOLO series algorithms (Faster-rcnn, Centernet, and other target detection models). The comparison results show that the method has the highest Mean Average Precision (mAP) of 92.2\% and the Frames Per Second (FPS) of 19 is second only to Centernet. Compared with the unimproved YOLOv7, the average accuracy in the recognition of tower cranes has increased by 11.9\%, which is the most obvious improvement in accuracy compared with other detection targets. Meanwhile, the hyperparameter optimization based on genetic algorithm speeds up the convergence of the model.},

This paper proposes a bird’s nest defect recognition method based on YOLOv5, which is composed of backbone network, FPN and YOLO head. After multiple rounds of training on the construction of the bird’s nest defect database and model of the transmission line, the independent identification and positioning of the bird’s nest has been realized. The results show that the recognition rate of the YOLOv5 model for the bird’s nest can reach 83.4\%, and the FPS can reach 85.32.

In this paper, we propose a detection and evaluation method of defect for transmission line inspection based on deep learning. The transmission line contains various pivotal components, while previous research has mostly focused on a few categories. In the proposed approach, the following study is performed by establishing a transmission line dataset named Wire\_10, which considers defects as a category. Wire\_10 contains 8 defects in transmission line components, such as insulator defect, triple-plate defect, damper defect, grading ring defect, and et al., as well as nest and foreign body that attached to the transmission line. The object detection of aerial images taken during the actual inspection is susceptible to background and lighting. These two factors are used as variables to define the background-dataset and the lighting-dataset. Faster R-CNN, an end-to-end and high recognition accuracy deep learning algorithm, is used to build detection models with transfer learning and fine-tuning. The results show that the detection method can accurately identify the defect categories in the Wire\_10 dataset and is robust to aerial images with complex backgrounds and different lighting. The proposed method can effectively and accurately identify defects in the automatic inspection of transmission lines.},

To address this problem, this article proposes an edge visual incremental perception framework, based on deep semi-supervised learning, for monitoring power transmission lines. After generation of the initial model using a small amount of labeled data, models trained using this framework can update themselves based on unlabeled data. A teacher-student joint training strategy, a data augmentation strategy, and a model updating strategy are also designed and adopted to improve the performance of the models trained with this framework. The proposed framework is then examined with various transmission line datasets with 1\%, 2\%, 5\%, and 10\% labeled data. General performance enhancement is thus confirmed against traditional supervised learning strategies. With the 10\% labeled data training set, the recognition accuracy of the model is improved to exceed 80\%, meeting the practical needs of power system operation, and thus clearly validating the effectiveness of the framework.},

Remarkable advances are made recently by mitigating distributional shifts via hierarchical domain feature alignment training of detection networks. However, domain adaptive object detection is still limited in learning the invariance representation of multi-scale features. Specifically, the scale of objects varies in the scenes of aerial inspection, which hinders the knowledge transfer from the labeled source domain. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale feature enhanced domain adaptation method for cross-domain object detection of power transmission lines inspection. The proposed method consists of two components: 1) Multi-Scale Fusion Feature Alignment module (MSFA) to strengthen similar representation characteristics of different scales object in domain adaptive by utilizing context information conveyed from other levels; 2) Multi-Scale Consistency Regularization module (MSCR) to jointly optimize the multi-scale feature learning of each level, which promotes domain invariant feature learning at each level. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly increases the performance of the object detector in several cross-scene transmission line inspection tasks.},

To address this issue, this article proposes a novel and high-accuracy defect detection method based on deep learning technology, named insulator defect detection network (I2D-Net), which incorporates several innovative modules. First, we design a three-path feature fusion network (TFFN) to improve the network’s ability to extract features from shallow layers. This hierarchical feature fusion mechanism across different network layers preserves spatial and semantic information, thereby maintaining the quality of features at different levels of the pyramid. Second, an enhanced receptive field attention (RFA+) block is incorporated to enable the network to adapt to different-scale defects and effectively distinguish them from the background. Finally, the context perception module (CPM) is introduced to better understand the surrounding features and their relationship with the defects. This improves defect localization capacity in the presence of interfering factors.

The SSD-based model can realize automatic multi-level feature extractor from aerial images instead of manually extracting features. Inspired by transfer learning, a two-stage fine-tuning strategy is implemented using separate training sets. In the first stage, the basic insulator model is obtained by fine-tuning the COCO model with aerial images, including different types of insulators and various backgrounds. In the second stage, the basic model is fine-tuned by the training sets of the specific insulator types and specific situations to be detected. After the two-stage fine-tuning, the well-trained SSD model can directly and accurately identify the insulator by feeding the aerial images. The results show that both the porcelain insulator and composite insulator can be quickly and accurately identified in the aerial images with complex background.

Then, LBDM is constructed to intelligently identify the bolt defects from the high-resolution image blocks. Considering that the features of ultrasmall targets are difficult to extract, feature extraction networks are constructed based on residual network (ResNet)-50, and the hybrid attention mechanism and multiscale feature fusion are introduced to further improve the network’s ability to extract shallow features.

These two branches are utilized to locate the fault region and estimate insulator endpoints, which presents a new representation for insulator faults. Endpoints of the faulty insulator string can provide detailed and correlative information for enhancing the diagnosis capability of component-dependent faults that occur on component bodies. The proposed Box-Point Detector implements all predictions including region and endpoint into one network thus forms an efficient end-to-end structure, and adopts a smaller downsampling ratio to generate high resolution feature-maps in order to preserve more original information for small size faults. Experimental results indicate that Box-Point Detector can accurately diagnose high-voltage insulator faults in real-time under various conditions.

The images captured from the aerial inspection can be utilized to detect the fault of insulators for further maintenance. For automatic transmission lines inspection system, the insulator fault detection is an interesting and challenging task due to the complex background and diversified insulators. In this paper, we propose a novel insulator fault detection method based on multi-level perception for aerial images. The multi-level perception is implemented by an ensemble architecture which combines three single-level perceptions. These single-level perceptions include the low level, middle level, and high level that are named by the attention to the insulator fault. They detect the insulator fault in the entire image, multi-insulator image, and single-insulator image, respectively. To address the filtering problem in the combination of three single-level perceptions, an ensemble method is proposed for generating the final results. For training the detection models employed in the multi-level perception, a powerful deep meta-architecture so-called single shot multibox detector (SSD) is utilized. The well-trained SSD models can automatically extract high quality features from aerial images instead of manually extracting features. By using the multi-level perception, the advantages of global and local information can achieve a favorable balance. Moreover, limited inspection images are fully utilized by the proposed method. Fault detection recall and precision of the proposed method are 93.69\% and 91.23\% testing in the practical inspection data, and insulator fault under various conditions can be correctly detected in the aerial images.

	abstract = {Pins are standard fasteners in power transmission lines, and the hidden dangers of pins falling off dramatically affects their safe operation. If a pin is missed, it is called pin defects in this paper. As the pin is a small target and has a complex background, traditional detection algorithms were used to identify pin defects from aerial images which suffer from poor accuracy and low efficiency. This paper proposed a target detection method based on cascaded convolutional neural networks. First, a small-scale shallow full convolutional neural network was used to obtain the region of interest; then, a deeper convolutional neural network conducted target classification and positioning on the obtained region of interest. Next, a nonlinear multilayer perceptron was introduced, the convolution kernel was decomposed, and the multi-scale feature maps were fused. At this point, an angle variable was added to the classification cross-entropy loss function. Multi-task learning and offline hard sample mining strategies were used in the training phase. The proposed method was tested on a self-built pin dataset and the remote sensing image RSOD dataset, and the experimental results proved its effectiveness. Our method can accurately identify pin defects in aerial images, thereby solving the engineering application problem of pin defect detection in transmission lines.},

How to perform accurate and timely detection of these foreign objects is an urgent problem. This paper proposes a lightweight YOLOv4 model with embedded dual attention mechanism (YOLOv4-EDAM) to detect foreign objects from visible images, using MobileNetV2 embedded with the squeeze and excitation networks (SENet) to replace the CSPDarkNet53 feature extraction network, the depthwise separable convolutions (DSC) to replace the standard convolutions in SPP and PANet module, and embedding the convolutional block attention module (CBAM) into SPP and PANet module to improve the detection accuracy. Firstly, an image dataset was constructed using inspection images and public datasets, and expanded by Poisson blending and some data augmentation methods. The denoising convolutional neural network (DnCNN) was applied for image preprocessing. Next, the lightweight YOLOv4-EDAM model was trained combining Mosaic data enhancement, cosine annealing and label smoothing skills. Several detection cases were carried out and the experimental results show that the proposed model has a high accuracy with the mean average precision (mAP) of 96.71\%, and a fast detection speed with the frames per second (FPS) of 45, whose overall performance is better than other object detection models. This study offers a reference for power line inspection and provides a possible way to deploy edge computing devices on unmanned aerial vehicles.},

In order to solve the high amount of computation brought by the deep neural network and meet the limited computing resources at the edge, a lightweight SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) target recognition network is designed at the edge, which adopts the MobileNets network to replace VGG16 network in the original model to reduce redundant computing. In the cloud, three detection algorithms (Faster-RCNN, Retinanet, YOLOv3) with obvious differences in detection performance are selected to obtain the coordinates and confidence of the insulator self-explosion area, and then the self-explosion fault detection of the overhead transmission line is realized by a novel multimodel fusion algorithm. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme can effectively reduce the amount of uploaded data, and the average recognition accuracy of the cloud is 95.75\%. In addition, it only increases the power consumption of edge devices by about 25.6W/h in their working state. Compared with the existing online monitoring technology of insulator selfexplosion at home and abroad, the proposed scheme has the advantages of low transmission delay, low communication cost and high diagnostic accuracy, which provides a new idea for online monitoring research of power internet of things equipment.},

	abstract = {The faults caused by insulator defects will seriously threaten the operational safety of the power grid. Therefore, insulator defect detection plays a crucial role in inspecting transmission lines. Compared with traditional methods, the network such as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family based on deep learning has high accuracy and strong robustness in insulator recognition and fault detection. However, the performance of these network is usually affected by the shooting conditions as well as aerial images with diverse types of insulators and complex backgrounds, resulting in poor detection result. In addition, the relatively small insulator fault (bunch-drop) area in aerial images will make detection difficult. To solve these problems, this article proposes an improved insulator defect detection model based on YOLOv4 (ID-YOLO). To create our model, we design a new backbone network structure, cross-stage partial and residual split attention network (CSP-ResNeSt), that can solve the interference problem of complex backgrounds in aerial images to enhance the network’s feature extraction capability. In addition, we adopt a new multiscale bidirectional feature pyramid network with simple attention module (Bi-SimAM-FPN), which can address the difficulty of identifying a small scale of insulator defects in an image for more efficient feature fusion. We experimentally demonstrate that the mean average precision (mAP) of the proposed model is 95.63\%, which is 3.5\% higher than that of the YOLOv4. Most importantly, the detection speed of this model can reach 63 frames/s, which meets the requirements of real-time detection of insulator bunch-drop faults.},

	abstract = {As the failure of power line insulators leads to the failure of power transmission systems, an insulator inspection system based on an aerial platform is widely used. Insulator defect detection is performed against complex backgrounds in aerial images, presenting an interesting but challenging problem. Traditional methods, based on handcrafted features or shallow learning techniques, can only localize insulators and detect faults under specific detection conditions, such as when sufficient prior knowledge is available, with low background interference, at certain object scales, or under specific illumination conditions. This paper discusses the automatic detection of insulator defects using aerial images, accurately localizing insulator defects appearing in input images captured from real inspection environments. We propose a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN) cascading architecture for performing localization and detecting defects in insulators. The cascading network uses a CNN based on a region proposal network to transform defect inspection into a two-level object detection problem. To address the scarcity of defect images in a real inspection environment, a data augmentation method is also proposed that includes four operations: 1) affine transformation; 2) insulator segmentation and background fusion; 3) Gaussian blur; and 4) brightness transformation. Defect detection precision and recall of the proposed method are 0.91 and 0.96 using a standard insulator dataset, and insulator defects under various conditions can be successfully detected. Experimental results demonstrate that this method meets the robustness and accuracy requirements for insulator defect detection.},

	abstract = {A novel Fusion Convolutional Network (FCN) is proposed in this research for potential real-time monitoring of insulators using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) edge devices. Precise airborne imaging of outdoor objects, such as high voltage insulators, suffers from varied object resolution, cluttered backgrounds, unclear or contaminated surfaces, and illumination conditions. Accurate information about the insulator surface condition is essential and is of a high priority since insulator breakdown is a leading cause of electrical failure. A multi-modal information fusion (MMIF) system is developed during this research to analyze and classify possible contaminations present on the electrical insulators. A novel system, referred to as FCN, consists of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a binary Multilayer Neural Network (MNN) sub-classifier. While constructing the MMIF dataset for training and testing the novel FCN, the image classification output of the CNN is combined with the leakage current values (LCV) obtained as the classification output of MNN. Each sample of the MMIF dataset is, therefore, represented as a series of fusions. Later, sub-classifiers, of the FCN, are trained to identify the contamination types in the fusion series by implementing a voting system of sub-classifiers which is trained to identify a given class. As a result of the implementation of the proposed FCN, the classification accuracy increased by 8.4\%, i.e., from 92\% to 99.76\%. To compare and benchmark the performance of proposed FCN, conventional classification algorithms are also implemented on the fusion of features that are extracted employing the wavelet transform and PCA methods. State-of-the-art CNN architectures are also discussed on account of their time consumption and memory usage. The conceptualization of a potential hardware implementation of the proposed FCN, on emerging edge devices, is also provided for completeness of the discussion. Pertinent outcomes of this research can be further extended to other potential applications of airborne imaging.},

Using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images of power line corridors is an effective way to carry out these vital inspections. In this paper, we propose an automatic inspection method for power lines using UAV images. This method, known as the power line automatic measurement method based on epipolar constraints (PLAMEC), acquires the spatial position of the power lines. Then, the semi patch matching based on epipolar constraints (SPMEC) dense matching method is applied to automatically extract dense point clouds within the power line corridor. Obstacles can then be automatically detected by calculating the spatial distance between a power line and the point cloud representing the ground. Experimental results show that the PLAMEC automatically measures power lines effectively with a measurement accuracy consistent with that of manual stereo measurements. The height root mean square (RMS) error of the point cloud was 0.233 m, and the RMS error of the power line was 0.205 m. In addition, we verified the detected obstacles in the field and measured the distance between the canopy and power line using a laser range finder. The results show that the difference of these two distances was within ±0.5 m.},

This data is analyzed by expert human inspectors to detect faults in the power lines infrastructure and prepare the inspection reports. This process is extremely time consuming, very expensive and prone to human error. In this paper, we present PoLIS: the Power Line Inspection Software, which has been developed with the objective of assisting the analysis of the data acquired during inspection flights. PoLIS is based on the cooperation between computer vision and machine learning techniques to automatically process video sequences acquired during inspection flights, resulting in a set of representative images per electric tower which we call Key Frames. These representative images can then be used for inspection purposes, leading to a drastic reduction of the human operators’ workload. At the core of the strategy lies an electric tower detector, which is in charge of estimating the location of the towers within the images based on the combination of a sliding window search technique and a supervised classifier. The location of the tower is then tracked using a tracking-by-registration algorithm based on direct methods, estimating the position of the tower in different images. Finally, different criteria are applied for defining whether the image corresponds to a Key Frame image or not. Extensive evaluation of the proposed strategy is conducted using videos acquired during manned helicopter inspections. The videos constituting this database contain several thousand frames representing both medium and high voltage power transmission lines in the infra-red (IR) and visible spectra. The obtained results show that the proposed strategy can reduce the large amount of data present in the inspection videos to a few Key Frames for each tower. It is also demonstrated that the learning-based approach proposed in PoLIS is appropriate for detecting electric towers, a process which is made faster and more robust by coupling it with a tower tracking algorithm. A Graphical User Interface allowing the application of PoLIS to user-provided videos is also presented in this paper, illustrating the whole process and the automated generation of an inspection report.},

This literature review article aims to give a wide overview of the possibilities provided by modern remote sensing sensors in power line corridor surveys and to discuss the potential and limitations of different approaches. Monitoring of both power line components and vegetation around them is included. Remotely sensed data sources discussed in the review include synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images, optical satellite and aerial images, thermal images, airborne laser scanner (ALS) data, land-based mobile mapping data, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) data. The review shows that most previous studies have concentrated on the mapping and analysis of network components. In particular, automated extraction of power line conductors has achieved much attention, and promising results have been reported. For example, accuracy levels above 90\% have been presented for the extraction of conductors from ALS data or aerial images. However, in many studies datasets have been small and numerical quality analyses have been omitted. Mapping of vegetation near power lines has been a less common research topic than mapping of the components, but several studies have also been carried out in this field, especially using optical aerial and satellite images. Based on the review we conclude that in future research more attention should be given to an integrated use of various data sources to benefit from the various techniques in an optimal way. Knowledge in related fields, such as vegetation monitoring from ALS, SAR and optical image data should be better exploited to develop useful monitoring approaches. Special attention should be given to rapidly developing remote sensing techniques such as UAVs and laser scanning from airborne and land-based platforms. To demonstrate and verify the capabilities of automated monitoring approaches, large tests in various environments and practical monitoring conditions are needed. These should include careful quality analyses and comparisons between different data sources, methods and individual algorithms.},

Two constructive heuristics were designed based on “Cluster First, Route Second” and “Route First, Split Second”. Then, local search strategies were developed to further improve the quality of the solution. To test the performance of the proposed algorithms, different-scale practical cases were designed based on the road network and powerline network of Ji’an, China.

	abstract = {Sequence of failures that aggravates catastrophic events of a power system has attracted a great number of researchers’ attention in exploring and analyzing its enormous losses to the society and economy of a country. Power system cascading collapse is an event in which failure of an electrical component such as transmission line or generator leads to sequence of failures in other equipment. This catastrophic event could lead to major electrical energy failure. Therefore, it is imperative to study the effect of power system cascading collapse in assessing reliability cost/worth. This research introduces the assessments of risk and reliability cost/worth-based Customer Interruption Cost (CIC) in relation to dynamic system cascading collapse. The results obtained from the analysis performed have proven that a large cost of CIC is resulted due to dynamic electrical energy failure. This connotes that uncertain disconnection of the exposed transmission lines together with the exposed generator which occurred in the power system failure, ultimately will impose a significant impact on the customer interruption cost. On top of that, the results of customer interruption cost also have proven that the uncertainty of dynamic power electrical power and energy failure should not be neglected. Therefore, the proposed technique is reliable and confers promising results in determining risk and reliability cost/worth of the system.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic wildland fires have resulted under extreme wind conditions due to power line system failures. Under conditions of “extreme fire weather”, multiple ignitions due to power lines over a broad geographic area can occur under conditions promoting explosive fire growth. Such instances have been observed in the US state of California in 2007, and several times in recent Australian history – most notably the lethal Black Saturday fires of 2009. Ignitions can occur from a variety of failure modes in the huge array of components making up distribution and transmission networks and their neighboring environment. These failures fall into two general categories however: elastic extension of either the conductors or surrounding objects (such as tree limbs) causing electrical contact and arcing, and fatigue failures under high strain conditions affecting system components (conductors, poles, crossarms) or surrounding objects (trees). Both failure classes show a strong dependence on increasing wind speed. Case studies will be shown demonstrating both of these categories. Greatly compounding these physical wind dependencies is the expectation that failure probability will increase sharply with wind speed in an extreme value statistical dependency, such as a reverse Weibull distribution. Outage data from electric distribution systems is shown to demonstrate a very strong increase with wind speed – suggesting that outage data from normal operation of an electrical grid may be used to gauge system vulnerability to extreme fire weather conditions. These results also underline the importance of having appropriate design requirements and contingency plans to account for reasonably foreseeable catastrophic weather conditions. Mitigation measures being discussed or implemented by regulators and utilities are discussed.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, a substantial increase in electricity demand has put pressure on powerline systems to ensure an uninterrupted power supply. In order to prevent power failures, timely and thorough powerline inspections are needed to detect possible anomalies in advance. In the past few years, the emerging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted sensors (e.g. light detection and ranging/lidar, optical cameras, infrared cameras, and ultraviolet cameras) have provided rich data sources for comprehensive and accurate powerline inspections. A challenge that still hinders the use of UAVs in powerline inspection is that their operation is highly dependent on the pilot’s experience, which may pose risks to the safety of the powerline system and reduce inspection efficiency. An intelligent automatic inspection solution could overcome the limitations of current UAV-based inspection solutions. The main objective of this paper is to provide a contemporary look at the current state-of-the-art UAV-based inspections as well as to discuss a potential lidar-supported intelligent powerline inspection concept. Overall, standardized protocols for lidar-supported intelligent powerline inspections include four data analysis steps, i.e., point cloud classification, key point extraction, route generation, and fault detection. To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed concept, we implemented a workflow using a dataset of 3536 powerline spans, showing that the inspection of a single powerline span could be completed in 10 min with only one or two technicians. This demonstrates that lidar-supported intelligent inspection can be used to inspect a powerline system with extremely high efficiency and low costs.},

The electricity transmission line image is typically situated in the top part of the image which is rather thin in size. Because the electricity transmission line is situated outside, there is frequently a sizable amount of sky in the backdrop. Firstly, an optimized quadtree segmentation method for calculating global atmospheric light is proposed, which gives higher weight to the upper part of the image with the sky region. This prevents interference from bright objects on the ground and guarantees that the global atmospheric light is computed in the top section of the image with the sky region. Secondly, a method of transmission calculation based on dark pixels is introduced. Finally, a detail sharpening post-processing based on visibility level and air light level is introduced to enhance the detail level of electricity transmission lines in the defogging image. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm performs well in enhancing the image details, preventing image distortion and avoiding image oversaturation.},

Firstly, Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is employed to extract the texture features of insulators and is calculated by the rapid Gray Level Co-occurrence Integrated Algorithm (GLCIA). We divide the extracted texture features into two categories: one with the stronger discriminative ability and the other with weaker ability. The second category is optimized by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to better distinguish the different texture objects with low contrast. Then, a new convex energy functional is defined by taking the non-convex model of the Texture Descriptor Active Contour (TDAC) into a global minimization framework (GMAC) during segmentation. The proposed energy functional can avoid the existence of local minima in the minimization of the TDAC. A fast dual formulation is introduced for the efficient evolution of the contour. The experimental results on synthetic and real aerial insulator remote sensing images have shown that the proposed algorithm obtains more satisfactory segmentation compared to the classical models in terms of accuracy, efficiency and independence of initial contour. The influence of the algorithm parameters is also analyzed.},

The results show that this method can localize multiple insulators with different orientation angles in complex aerial image, and has higher positioning precision, lower computational complexity and lower time consuming compared with existing methods.

We also describe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in a novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build mobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which we call Mobile DeepLabv3. The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where the input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite to traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input an MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in the intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to remove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain representational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and provide an intuition that led to this design. Finally, our approach allows decoupling of the input/output domains from the expressiveness of the transformation, which provides a convenient framework for further analysis. We measure our performance on Imagenet classification, COCO object detection, VOC image segmentation. We evaluate the trade-offs between accuracy, and number of operations measured by multiply-adds (MAdd), as well as the number of parameters},

	abstract = {Despite a relatively crowded literature about detection of power lines for aircraft safety, the works are mostly optimized with very few training images; some even use artificially generated images. The IR imaging case is even less utilized. The reason is clearly the tremendous workload to obtain real images. With this demand in mind, the authors cooperated with the Turkish Electricity Transmission Company (TEIAS) to obtain video captures from actual aircrafts. Later, the authors made a thorough inspection over the video frames to isolate, capture and clean thousands of valuable images. In this content, 4000 IR and 4000 VL images are acquired and scaled to a size of 128x128. The IR folder contains 2000 IR images with power line and 2000 IR images with no power line. The VL folder contains 2000 VL images with power line and 2000 VL images with no power line. The IR and VL groups were deliberately constructed to contain both regular and especially confusing scenes. "TY" shows that there are no power lines in the images. "TV" shows that there are power lines in the images. The videos were captured from 21 different regions all over Turkey at different seasonal days. Due to varying background behavior, varying temperatures and weather conditions, and varying lighting conditions, the achieved positive set contains several difficult scenes where low contrast causes close-to invisibility for power lines. The original video resolutions were 576x325 for IR and full HD for VL, however, the captured frames were scaled down to smaller sizes and the effect of resizing was tested for various image sizes. An image size of 128x128 is sufficient for a consistently accurate power line recognition.},

	abstract = {The "Roaring 20s" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually "modernize" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8\% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.},

We use new features: WRC, CSP, CmBN, SAT, Mish activation, Mosaic data augmentation, CmBN, DropBlock regularization, and CIoU loss, and combine some of them to achieve state-of-the-art results: 43.5\% AP (65.7\% AP50) for the MS COCO dataset at a realtime speed of {\textasciitilde}65 FPS on Tesla V100.

	abstract = {We introduce YOLO9000, a state-of-the-art, real-time object detection system that can detect over 9000 object categories. First we propose various improvements to the YOLO detection method, both novel and drawn from prior work. The improved model, YOLOv2, is state-of-the-art on standard detection tasks like PASCAL VOC and COCO. At 67 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 76.8 mAP on VOC 2007. At 40 FPS, YOLOv2 gets 78.6 mAP, outperforming state-of-the-art methods like Faster RCNN with ResNet and SSD while still running significantly faster. Finally we propose a method to jointly train on object detection and classification. Using this method we train YOLO9000 simultaneously on the COCO detection dataset and the ImageNet classification dataset. Our joint training allows YOLO9000 to predict detections for object classes that don't have labelled detection data. We validate our approach on the ImageNet detection task. YOLO9000 gets 19.7 mAP on the ImageNet detection validation set despite only having detection data for 44 of the 200 classes. On the 156 classes not in COCO, YOLO9000 gets 16.0 mAP. But YOLO can detect more than just 200 classes; it predicts detections for more than 9000 different object categories. And it still runs in real-time.},

	abstract = {We present YOLO, a new approach to object detection. Prior work on object detection repurposes classifiers to perform detection. Instead, we frame object detection as a regression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and associated class probabilities. A single neural network predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images in one evaluation. Since the whole detection pipeline is a single network, it can be optimized end-to-end directly on detection performance. Our unified architecture is extremely fast. Our base YOLO model processes images in real-time at 45 frames per second. A smaller version of the network, Fast YOLO, processes an astounding 155 frames per second while still achieving double the mAP of other real-time detectors. Compared to state-of-the-art detection systems, YOLO makes more localization errors but is far less likely to predict false detections where nothing exists. Finally, YOLO learns very general representations of objects. It outperforms all other detection methods, including DPM and R-CNN, by a wide margin when generalizing from natural images to artwork on both the Picasso Dataset and the People-Art Dataset.},

	title = {Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation},
	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1311.2524},
	abstract = {Object detection performance, as measured on the canonical PASCAL VOC dataset, has plateaued in the last few years. The best-performing methods are complex ensemble systems that typically combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context. In this paper, we propose a simple and scalable detection algorithm that improves mean average precision (mAP) by more than 30\% relative to the previous best result on VOC 2012---achieving a mAP of 53.3\%. Our approach combines two key insights: (1) one can apply high-capacity convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to bottom-up region proposals in order to localize and segment objects and (2) when labeled training data is scarce, supervised pre-training for an auxiliary task, followed by domain-specific fine-tuning, yields a significant performance boost. Since we combine region proposals with CNNs, we call our method R-CNN: Regions with CNN features. We also compare R-CNN to OverFeat, a recently proposed sliding-window detector based on a similar CNN architecture. We find that R-CNN outperforms OverFeat by a large margin on the 200-class ILSVRC2013 detection dataset. Source code for the complete system is available at http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/{\textasciitilde}rbg/rcnn.},
