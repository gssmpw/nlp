% \Heading{Abstract}

\noindent Advances in foundation modeling have reshaped computational pathology. However, the increasing number of available models and lack of standardized benchmarks make it increasingly complex to assess their strengths, limitations, and potential for further development. To address these challenges, we introduce a new suite of software tools: \href{https://github.com/mahmoodlab/trident/}{\textbf{Trident}} for whole-slide image processing, \href{https://github.com/mahmoodlab/patho-bench}{\textbf{Patho-Bench}} for foundation model benchmarking, and \href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/MahmoodLab/Patho-Bench}{\textbf{Patho-Bench tasks}} with clinically relevant tasks sourced from public data. We anticipate that these resources will promote transparency, reproducibility, and continued progress in the field.
