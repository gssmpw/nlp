Boltzmann generators (BGs) ____ have been applied to both free energy estimation ____ and molecular sampling. Initially, BGs relied on system-specific representations, such as internal coordinates, to achieve relevant sampling efficiencies ____. However, these representations are generally not transferable across different systems, leading to the development of BGs in Cartesian coordinates ____. While this improves transferability, they are currently limited in scalability, struggling to extend beyond dipeptides. Scaling to larger systems typically requires sacrificing exact sampling from the target distribution  ____, which often includes coarse-graining. 
An alternative to direct sampling from $\mu_{\text{target}}(x)$ is to generate samples iteratively by learning large steps in time ____.
