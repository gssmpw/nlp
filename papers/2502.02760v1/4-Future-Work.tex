\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:futurework}
We present the first study of flaky tests in Rust from GitHub projects. In future work, we aim to continue our study of the dataset with 1,146 issues related to potential Rust flaky tests and explore methods for detecting and addressing flakiness in Rust. Additionally, we will investigate how language features influence flaky tests across different programming languages.
