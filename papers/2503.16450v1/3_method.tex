We gathered input from primary stakeholders of the robot dog guide, divided into three subgroups: BVI individuals who have owned a dog guide, BVI individuals who were not dog guide owners, and sighted individuals with generally low degrees of familiarity with dog guides. While the main focus of this study was on the BVI participants, we elected to include survey responses from sighted participants given the importance of social acceptance of the robot by the general public, which could reflect upon the BVI users themselves and affect their interactions with the general population \cite{kayukawa2022perceive}. 

The need-finding processes consisted of two stages. During Stage 1, we conducted in-depth interviews with BVI participants, querying their experiences in using conventional assistive technologies and dog guides. During Stage 2, a large-scale survey was distributed to both BVI and sighted participants. 

This study was approved by the Universityâ€™s Institutional Review Board (IRB), and all processes were conducted after obtaining the participants' consent.

\subsection{Stage 1: Interviews}
We recruited nine BVI participants (\textbf{Table}~\ref{tab:bvi-info}) for in-depth interviews, which lasted 45-90 minutes for current or former dog guide owners (DO) and 30-60 minutes for participants without dog guides (NDO). Group DO consisted of five participants, while Group NDO consisted of four participants.
% The interview participants were divided into two groups. Group DO (Dog guide Owner) consisted of five participants who were current or former dog guide owners and Group NDO (Non Dog guide Owner) consisted of three participants who were not dog guide owners. 
All participants were familiar with using white canes as a mobility aid. 

We recruited participants in both groups, DO and NDO, to gather data from those with substantial experience with dog guides, offering potentially more practical insights, and from those without prior experience, providing a perspective that may be less constrained and more open to novel approaches. 

We asked about the participants' overall impressions of a robot dog guide, expectations regarding its potential benefits and challenges compared to a conventional dog guide, their desired methods of giving commands and communicating with the robot dog guide, essential functionalities that the robot dog guide should offer, and their preferences for various aspects of the robot dog guide's form factors. 
For Group DO, we also included questions that asked about the participants' experiences with conventional dog guides. 

% We obtained permission to record the conversations for our records while simultaneously taking notes during the interviews. The interviews lasted 30-60 minutes for NDO participants and 45-90 minutes for DO participants. 

\subsection{Stage 2: Large-Scale Surveys} 
After gathering sufficient initial results from the interviews, we created an online survey for distributing to a larger pool of participants. The survey platform used was Qualtrics. 

\subsubsection{Survey Participants}
The survey had 100 participants divided into two primary groups. Group BVI consisted of 42 blind or visually impaired participants, and Group ST consisted of 58 sighted participants. \textbf{Table}~\ref{tab:survey-demographics} shows the demographic information of the survey participants. 

\subsubsection{Question Differentiation} 
Based on their responses to initial qualifying questions, survey participants were sorted into three subgroups: DO, NDO, and ST. Each participant was assigned one of three different versions of the survey. The surveys for BVI participants mirrored the interview categories (overall impressions, communication methods, functionalities, and form factors), but with a more quantitative approach rather than the open-ended questions used in interviews. The DO version included additional questions pertaining to their prior experience with dog guides. The ST version revolved around the participants' prior interactions with and feelings toward dog guides and dogs in general, their thoughts on a robot dog guide, and broad opinions on the aesthetic component of the robot's design.
