\noindent\textbf{Blind Assistive Technology.}
Prior studies have explored the development of various forms of blind assistive technology. The most studied device has been the technology-assisted white cane, or `smart cane'. Earlier versions of a smart cane were built with ultrasonic sensors to detect objects at various distances, of which the cane would then alert the user through audio output, such as a voice message or beeping tones ____. Later iterations have included more advanced obstacle detection systems, smartphone connectivity, and embedded navigation software, paired with a control panel to allow inputs from the user ____.  
However, smart canes, as well as other, less common forms of blind assistive technology, have struggled to be adopted by BVI white cane users, largely due to challenges with design and user interface ____. Commonly reported usability issues with smart canes included slow alert times in response to obstacles, difficulty detecting fast-moving objects, inability to detect objects below knee-level (therefore still requiring ground-tapping for floor-level obstacles not unlike with a conventional white cane), and insufficient battery life when in continuous use ____,____.
