\begin{abstract}

Dog guides offer an effective mobility solution for blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals, but conventional dog guides have limitations including the need for care, potential distractions, societal prejudice, high costs, and limited availability. To address these challenges, we seek to develop a robot dog guide capable of performing the tasks of a conventional dog guide, enhanced with additional features. In this work, we focus on design research to identify functional and aesthetic design concepts to implement into a quadrupedal robot. The aesthetic design remains relevant even for BVI users due to their sensitivity toward societal perceptions and the need for smooth integration into society. We collected data through interviews and surveys to answer specific design questions pertaining to the appearance, texture, features, and method of controlling and communicating with the robot. Our study identified essential and preferred features for a future robot dog guide, which are supported by relevant statistics aligning with each suggestion. These findings will inform the future development of user-centered designs to effectively meet the needs of BVI individuals. 
% Dog guides offer an effective mobility solution for blind or visually impaired (BVI) individuals, but the high costs and length of training significantly limit their availability. Consequently, only a small fraction of BVI individuals who could benefit from a dog guide are able to access them. To address these challenges, we seek to develop a robot dog guide capable of performing the tasks of a conventional dog guide, enhanced with additional features. We are currently focused on design research, with the goal of identifying functional and aesthetic design concepts to implement into a quadruped robot. We collected data through interviews and surveys to answer specific design questions pertaining to the appearance, texture, features, and method of controlling and communicating with the robot. Some key findings from the BVI participants included the following: the participants had an overall favorable impression of a future robot dog guide and acknowledged numerous potential advantages that it could offer; most participants showed some preference for the robot to resemble the appearance of a real dog and look "cute" or "approachable", as well as for it to have a uniform identifier indicating it as a guide; they were in favor of the robot having a built-in GPS and Bluetooth connectivity and being made of waterproof material; they showed some preference for a softer external texture rather than a rigid one; they wanted to have the multiple options of voice command, motion gesture, and buttons on the harness as methods of giving commands to the robot, and both auditory signals and haptic feedback as methods of receiving signals from the robot; they emphasized the need for a long battery life and reliable battery percentage indicator and were highly favorable toward a self-charging capability. These data inform us on directions for prototyping, enabling us to narrow in on designs that effectively meet the needs of BVI individuals.
