\caption{Several cases with significant deviations from the co-occurrence metric are shown here. $N_s$ is the number of paragraphs in which the subject appears, $N_o$ is the number of paragraphs in which the object appears, and $N_{s,o}$ is the number of paragraphs in which they co-occur. The first two cases exhibit rare co-occurrence but demonstrate high accuracy, whereas the latter two cases show frequent co-occurrence but exhibit low accuracy.}
