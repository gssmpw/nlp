\caption{Overview of Our Method. First, we construct an evaluation set of CBQA tasks. Second, we meticulously build 1.5 trillion tokens of high-quality pre-training data. Third, we pre-train base models at three different scales and employ a multi-template complementation mechanism to accurately assess the modelâ€™s memory ACC for the knowledge triples in the evaluation set. Fourth, we retrieve these knowledge triples from the pre-training data and introduce the SMI metric. Finally, we use linear regression to establish a predictive equation between SMI and ACC, and calculate $\text{R}^2$ and MSE to evaluate the predictive performance.}
