\section{Templates for Knowledge Triples}
\input{tables/templates}
We create twenty templates for each type of knowledge triple. Table~\ref{templates} illustrates the templates for the \(\mathbf{BORN}\) relation, along with their corresponding evaluation ACC on the 13B model. As shown, the choice of template has a significant impact on the modelâ€™s ACC in answering questions. To address the instability of evaluations based on a single template, we calculate the average accuracy across all 20 templates.



\section{Case Study}
\input{tables/case_study}
Table~\ref{case_study} highlights four counterintuitive cases. From these, we observe the following: (1) In the first two cases, the subject and object rarely co-occur, suggesting a seemingly weak relationship. However, whenever the subject does appear, the object almost always appears alongside it, resulting in high accuracy. (2) In the last two cases, despite frequent co-occurrence between the subject and object, their individual occurrence frequencies are significantly higher, leading to low accuracy. For example, when prompted with ``Paris is located in'', the model is more likely to respond with ``France'' rather than ``Europe''.

These examples highlight the pivotal role of knowledge specificity in the memory of LLMs. It is not simply the frequencies of knowledge occurrence that enhance retention, but rather the specificity of the knowledge that proves more influential. This insight suggests that in downstream task training, even when domain-specific data is significantly fewer than the pre-training data, minimizing repetition with the pre-training data can increase the SMI. This makes it easier for LLMs to retain the relevant knowledge.


\section{Experimental Results on Each Relation}
\input{figures/15relations}
Figure~\ref{15relations} illustrates the evaluation results for each knowledge triple relation in the 13B model. We observe that: (1) The $\text{R}^2$ for individual relations is lower than that of the entire evaluation set, probably due to insufficient data for specific relations. (2) The results vary significantly across different relations, indicating that when applying our method, it is essential to account for biases introduced by the relation types of the knowledge triples.
