abstract = {It is shown that any recognition problem solved by a polynomial time-bounded nondeterministic Turing machine can be “reduced” to the problem of determining whether a given propositional formula is a tautology. Here “reduced” means, roughly speaking, that the first problem can be solved deterministically in polynomial time provided an oracle is available for solving the second. From this notion of reducible, polynomial degrees of difficulty are defined, and it is shown that the problem of determining tautologyhood has the same polynomial degree as the problem of determining whether the first of two given graphs is isomorphic to a subgraph of the second. Other examples are discussed. A method of measuring the complexity of proof procedures for the predicate calculus is introduced and discussed.},

abstract="Weighted abduction computes hypotheses that explain input observations. It employs parameters, called weights, to output hypotheses suitable for each application. This versatility makes it applicable to plant operation, cybersecurity or discourse analysis. However, the hypotheses selected by an abductive reasoner from among possible hypotheses may be inconsistent with the user's knowledge such as an operator's or analyst's expertise. In order to resolve this inconsistency and generate hypotheses in accordance with the user's knowledge, this paper proposes two user-feedback dialogue protocols in which the user points out, either positively or negatively, properties of the hypotheses presented by the reasoner, and the reasoner regenerates hypotheses that satisfy the user's feedback. As a minimum requirement for user-feedback dialogue protocols, we then prove that our protocols necessarily terminate under certain reasonable conditions and achieve a fixed target hypothesis if the user determines the positivity or negativity of each pointed-out property based on whether the target hypothesis has that property.",

abstract = {This chapter explores the logical framework called weighted abduction as applied to solving discourse-processing tasks. Weighted abduction incorporates a cost propagation mechanism allowing us to estimate the likelihood of the obtained abductive proofs. We use a tractable implementation of weighted abduction based on Integer Linear Programming and a large knowledge base generated automatically. We first perform an experiment on plan recognition using the dataset originally developed for Ng and Mooney’s system [39]. Then we apply our discourse processing pipeline for predicting whether one text fragment logically entails another one (Recognizing Textual Entailment task). The study we describe is the first attempt to apply tractable inference-based natural language processing on a large scale.}

abstract = {Abduction is inference to the best explanation. In the TACITUS project at SRI we have developed an approach to abductive inference, called “weighted abduction”, that has resulted in a significant simplification of how the problem of interpreting texts is conceptualized. The interpretation of a text is the minimal explanation of why the text would be true. More precisely, to interpret a text, one must prove the logical form of the text from what is already mutually known, allowing for coercions, merging redundancies where possible, and making assumptions where necessary. It is shown how such “local pragmatics” problems as reference resolution, the interpretation of compound nominals, the resolution of syntactic ambiguity and metonymy, and schema recognition can be solved in this manner. Moreover, this approach of “interpretation as abduction” can be combined with the older view of “parsing as deduction” to produce an elegant and thorough integration of syntax, semantics, and pragmatics, one that spans the range of linguistic phenomena from phonology to discourse structure. Finally, we discuss means for making the abduction process efficient, possibilities for extending the approach to other pragmatics phenomena, and the semantics of the weights and costs in the abduction scheme.}

abstract = {The edge-connectivity of a connected graph or hypergraph is the minimum number of edges whose removal renders the graph or hypergraph, respectively, disconnected. The edge-connectivity of a (hyper) graph cannot exceed its minimum degree. For graphs, several sufficient conditions for equality of edge-connectivity and minimum degree are known. For example Chartrand (1966) showed that for every graph of order n and minimum degree at least n−12 its edge-connectivity equals its minimum degree. We show that this and some other well-known sufficient conditions generalise to hypergraphs.}

abstract = {In 1969 Cordell presented his seminal description of planning as theorem proving with the situation calculus. The most pleasing feature of Green's account was the negligible gap between high-level logical specification and practical implementation. This paper attempts to reinstate the ideal of planning via theorem proving in a modern guise. In particular, the paper shows that if we adopt the event calculus as our logical formalism and employ abductive logic programming as our theorem proving technique, then the computation performed mirrors closely that of a hand-coded partial-order planning algorithm. Soundness and completeness results for this logic programming implementation are given. Finally the paper shows that, if we extend the event calculus in a natural way to accommodate compound actions, then using the same abductive theorem proving techniques we can obtain a hierarchical planner.}

abstract = {By determining what added assumptions would suffice to make the logical form of a sentence in natural language provable, abductive inference can be used in the interpretation of sentences to determine what information should be added to the listener's knowledge, i.e., what he should learn from the sentence. This is a comparatively new application of mechanized abduction. A new form of abduction — least specific abduction — is proposed as being more appropriate to the task of interpreting natural language than the forms that have been used in the traditional diagnostic and design-synthesis applications of abduction. The assignment of numerical costs to axioms and assumable literals permits specification of preferences on different abductive explanations. A new Prolog-like inference system that computes abductive explanations and their costs is given. To facilitate the computation of minimum-cost explanations, the inference system, unlike others such as Prolog, is designed to avoid the repeated use of the same instance of an axiom or assumption.}

We present a general framework for representing dialogues and give the details necessary to generate two subtypes of inquiry dialogue that we define: argument inquiry dialogues allow two agents to share knowledge to jointly construct arguments; warrant inquiry dialogues allow two agents to share knowledge to jointly construct dialectical trees (essentially a tree with an argument at each node in which a child node is a counter argument to its parent). Existing inquiry dialogue systems only model dialogues, meaning they provide a protocol which dictates what the possible legal next moves are but not which of these moves to make. Our system not only includes a dialogue-game style protocol for each subtype of inquiry dialogue that we present, but also a strategy that selects exactly one of the legal moves to make. We propose a benchmark against which we compare our dialogues, being the arguments that can be constructed from the union of the agents’ beliefs, and use this to define soundness and completeness properties that we show hold for all inquiry dialogues generated by our system.}
