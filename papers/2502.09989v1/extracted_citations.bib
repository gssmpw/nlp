abstract = {The majority of existing work on agent dialogues considers negotiation, persuasion or deliberation dialogues; we focus on inquiry dialogues, which allow agents to collaborate in order to find new knowledge. We present a general framework for representing dialogues and give the details necessary to generate two subtypes of inquiry dialogue that we define: argument inquiry dialogues allow two agents to share knowledge to jointly construct arguments; warrant inquiry dialogues allow two agents to share knowledge to jointly construct dialectical trees (essentially a tree with an argument at each node in which a child node is a counter argument to its parent). Existing inquiry dialogue systems only model dialogues, meaning they provide a protocol which dictates what the possible legal next moves are but not which of these moves to make. Our system not only includes a dialogue-game style protocol for each subtype of inquiry dialogue that we present, but also a strategy that selects exactly one of the legal moves to make. We propose a benchmark against which we compare our dialogues, being the arguments that can be constructed from the union of the agents’ beliefs, and use this to define soundness and completeness properties that we show hold for all inquiry dialogues generated by our system.}

abstract="We have been developing an AI-based system that automatically collects evidence from logs on computers within an intranet and infers the most plausible hypothesis of a cyber-attack. In this paper, we propose a user-interactive functionality which enables the system to incorporate knowledge and insight from the user in order to build the hypothesis. We show the system's practicality with example use cases and also confirm the necessity of such functionality for the system by interviewing with cyber security analysts.Motoura, ShotaHoshino, AyakoHosomi, Itaru",

abstract = {By determining what added assumptions would suffice to make the logical form of a sentence in natural language provable, abductive inference can be used in the interpretation of sentences to determine what information should be added to the listener's knowledge, i.e., what he should learn from the sentence. This is a comparatively new application of mechanized abduction. A new form of abduction — least specific abduction — is proposed as being more appropriate to the task of interpreting natural language than the forms that have been used in the traditional diagnostic and design-synthesis applications of abduction. The assignment of numerical costs to axioms and assumable literals permits specification of preferences on different abductive explanations. A new Prolog-like inference system that computes abductive explanations and their costs is given. To facilitate the computation of minimum-cost explanations, the inference system, unlike others such as Prolog, is designed to avoid the repeated use of the same instance of an axiom or assumption.}
