\begin{abstract}
Science communication increases public interest in science by educating, engaging, and encouraging everyday people to participate in the sciences. But traditional science communication is often too formal and inaccessible for general audiences. However, there is a growing trend on social media to make it more approachable using three techniques: relatable examples to make explanations concrete, step-by-step walkthroughs to improve understanding, and personal language to drive engagement. These techniques are flashy and often garner more engagement from social media users, but the effectiveness of these techniques in actually explaining the science is unknown. Furthermore, many scientists struggle with adopting these science communication strategies for social media, fearing it might undermine their authority. We conduct a reader study to understand how these science communication techniques on social media affect readers' understanding and engagement of the science. We found that while most readers prefer these techniques, they had diverse preferences for when and where these techniques are used. With these findings, we conducted a writer study to understand how scientists' varying comfort levels with these strategies can be supported by presenting different structure and style options. We found that the side-by-side comparison of options helped writers make editorial decisions. Instead of adhering to one direction of science communication, writers explored a continuum of options which helped them identify which communication strategies they wanted to implement.

% Despite this, scientists shy away from using colloquial language, fearing it might undermine their authority. To rationalize writers’ fears, we conducted a reader study to understand audience impressions. We found that while readers prefer these techniques, they can detract from understanding complex topics. To understand how writers’ fears can be mitigated, we conducted a writer study that provided different options of structuring and styling science explanations. We found that the side-by-side viewing of options helped with writing decisions. Instead of adhering to one direction of science communication, writers explored a continuum of options and the process helped reduce their fears of using colloquial techniques.

% We found that while these elements can engage readers, they sometimes detract from understanding complex topics. 
% Furthermore, to understand how writers' fears can be mitigated, we conducted a writer study that showed writers different options of structuring and styling their science explanations. We found that writers had diverse preferences for presenting science to a larger audience. We also found that the side-by-side viewing of different structure and styles helped writers decide which option to choose. Furthermore, it also inspired writers to merge different aspects of each condition together. These findings demonstrate the importance of showing writers different approaches to science writing and to help dispell writers' anxiety about adhering to one method of science communication. to helps them explore a continuum of options.

% Based on these insights, we developed a system that helps science writers balance engagement and clarity by offering LLM-generated suggestions with and without colloquial properties. We found that this side-by-side comparison helped writers explore different explanation methods. In conclusion, while colloquial language can enhance engagement, it must be used carefully to avoid weakening explanations.
