We have introduced $\pname$, a secure protocol for cross-rollup composability, enabling users to atomically execute transactions spanning two rollups, guaranteeing the all-or-nothing and serializability properties. Our protocol is flexible since it supports rollups on distinct L1s, as well as rollups operated by distinct Executors. We provided two formal models for cross-rollup transactions (CRTs), and defined atomicity within them. Our novel formal treatment gave rise to the shortcomings of other works and allowed us to rigorously prove security for $\pname$. We implemented and benchmarked all components of $\pname$ and an end-to-end cross-rollup flash loan application to demonstrate the practicality of $\pname$.
