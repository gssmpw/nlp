\textbf{Illustration of the \Ours framework.} \Ours is an adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach incorporating three key components: the Adaptive Information Collector (AIC), the Multi-Granular Content Filter (MCF), and the Agent-Based Memory Updater (AMU). The MCF filters chunks irrelevant to the query and extracts the most useful sentences. Subsequently, the AMU updates the generated memory notes. Finally, the AIC evaluates the quality of the memory and determines whether further iterations are necessary.}
