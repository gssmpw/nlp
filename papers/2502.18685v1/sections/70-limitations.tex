\section{Limitations}
Our analysis of user and \abr{LLM} expertise misalignment and its downstream impacts is based on predicted expertise labels and predicted user satisfaction scores (\abr{SAT}). While we human validated the classification labels, there is still a possibility of some errors which could impact the results. 
We study conversations only in English, which may limit the generalizability our findings, given that a lot of conversations with Copilot take place in non-English languages. Our analysis is limited to English conversations to facilitate human-validation of predicted expertise labels. Future work may consider extending our findings in the multi-lingual domain.
% While our findings show the negative impact of user underestimation, it cannot be said that over-estimation does not have a negative impact on the user experience. We hope that our work motivates researchers to delve more into the problem of user and agent expertise misalignment.
We use the same prompts to predict user and agent expertise on all the topical domains of our conversations. While more personalized templates might be able to capture the notions of expertise more accurately for different domains, we use the same template throughout to be able to make a fair comparison across all our experimental settings. 
Additionally, we only use GPT-4 to predict the expertise labels. While it is possible that other \abr{LLMs} might be able to judge the expertise better, we restrict ourselves to the same model as the SAT rubric and the task complexity classifier to maintian model consistency. Future work may consider extending our expertise classifier to evaluate the alignment between humans and multiple different \abr{LLMs}.
Finally, all our results are correlational, but do indicate that a mismatch in expertise between the user and \abr{LLMs} could be one of the causes of user dissatisfaction. We hope our findings motivate future works to involve experiments where agent expertise can be manipulated to determine whether it has a causal impact on user satisfaction or not.
