\begin{abstract}
While Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate impressive reasoning capabilities, understanding and validating their knowledge utilization remains challenging. Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting partially addresses this by revealing intermediate reasoning steps, but the knowledge flow and application remain implicit. We introduce IAO (Input-Action-Output) prompting, a structured template-based method that explicitly models how LLMs access and apply their knowledge during complex reasoning tasks. IAO decomposes problems into sequential steps, each clearly identifying the input knowledge being used, the action being performed, and the resulting output. This structured decomposition enables us to trace knowledge flow, verify factual consistency, and identify potential knowledge gaps or misapplications. Through experiments across diverse reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that IAO not only improves zero-shot performance but also provides transparency in how LLMs leverage their stored knowledge. Human evaluation confirms that this structured approach enhances our ability to verify knowledge utilization and detect potential hallucinations or reasoning errors. Our findings provide insights into both knowledge representation within LLMs and methods for more reliable knowledge application.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we propose IAO prompting, a novel template-based approach that guides Large Language Models (LLMs) towards decomposing complex problems into manageable steps. By explicitly structuring input information, planned actions, and intermediate outputs, IAO facilitates sequential problem-solving. Our evaluations across diverse reasoning tasks demonstrate performance gains, increased clarity, improved structural coherence, and enhanced transparency within the reasoning chain. Moreover, IAO shows domain independence, requiring minimal adaptation to cater to different problem types. Additional human evaluation validates IAO utility in finding errors in free-text reasoning chains.

\section*{Limitations}
While IAO prompting demonstrates compelling advantages in terms of performance and transparency, it is crucial to acknowledge potential limitations:
\paragraph{Output Length}: The structured nature of IAO prompts might lead to lengthier responses compared to baseline models. This can have implications on computational costs and real-time applicability, particularly in resource-constrained settings. Future work could explore techniques for compressing the output or developing domain-specific adaptations to mitigate this limitation.
\paragraph{Interpretability Trade-off}: While the structured output enhances interpretability, it is important to consider that some users might prefer more concise summaries. The human evaluation study supports this. In fact, when the answer is correct, evaluators heavily preferred CoT reasoning chains over IAO's. This suggests a potential trade-off between detailed explanations and user preferences. Future work could explore methods to balance the level of detail and provide tailored interpretations based on individual user needs.

\section*{Ethical Considerations}

While IAO holds promise for improved reasoning, concerns arise regarding potential bias amplification and misuse as per any prompting method for LLMs. Breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps could inadvertently magnify existing biases in the LLM or training data, leading to biased final outputs. This necessitates careful bias detection and mitigation. Additionally, the structured nature could be exploited to "trick" the model, generating harmful or misleading outputs. Safeguards like fact-checking and verification become crucial, especially in sensitive domains. Responsible deployment and use are fundamental to ensure LLMs benefits are harnessed ethically and its risks are minimized.

\section{Additional Related Work}
\paragraph{Prompting}
Chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting provides intermediate rationales in the reasoning chain for solving problems, leading to improved accuracy and interpretability in tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. The common instance of CoT is zero-shot CoT \cite{kojima2022large} and few-shot CoT \cite{wei2022chain}. The first one is the most relevant to our work. 
On the other hand, few-shot prompting requires manually constructed task-specific demonstrations, so it is more costly. 
\citet{zhang2022automatic} proposed an approach to automatically construct few-shot demonstrations based on zero-shot prompting to save the manual cost. Another categorization for prompting methods is based on whether they involve a single step or multiple steps. An example of multi-step prompting is the work by \citet{zhou2022least} which is discussed in the next paragraph. There are several CoT prompts with structured reasoning chains in the form of programs \cite{chen2023program}, graphs \cite{besta2024graph} or tables \cite{ziqi-lu-2023-tab}. In this work we focus on free-text reasoning chains.

\section{Ablation studies}
\Cref{tab:ablation_results_appendix} shows how removing each field impacts the model's accuracy on different tasks. This helps understand the importance and relevance of each field in guiding the model towards successful completion of tasks.
For example, removing the "Subquestion" field seems to have a significant negative impact on the "Date Understanding" accuracy, suggesting that subquestions might provide crucial context for understanding temporal information.
The Last Letter task seems most affected by any field removal, highlighting its dependence on full prompt context. 


\section{Experimental setting}
All results reported for PALM-2 are the results of average over 3 runs. The results reported for GPT-4 are over a single run due to higher costs. 
For each model, the temperature was set to 0, the maximum number of output tokens was set to 1024.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{gpt-4-1106-preview}: \url{https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo}
    \item \texttt{PALM-2 (text-unicorn)}: \url{https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/model-reference/text}

\caption{Average output word count.}\label{tab:wc_avg}
\end{table}

We sampled 50 reasoning chains for each model across various benchmarks and report the average output word count.
GPT-4 tends to be more verbose in CoT and IAO structure helps in shortening the output reasoning but the opposite is seen in PALM-2.

\section{Errors from AQua}
\textbf{Note:} Several questions where IAO gave the wrong answers were due to the output exceeding the maximum number of tokens. 
\subsection{Example 1}
\textit{Question}: A grocer makes a 25\% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour it sells. If he sells each bag for \$100 and makes \$3,000 in profit, how many bags did he sell? 

\textit{Answer Choices}: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40"

\textit{GT}:  "C"

\paragraph{IAO}:
\noindent
\textbf{Step 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} What is the profit made on one bag of flour?
    \item \textit{Input:} 25\% profit on the selling price of \$100 per bag
    \item \textit{Action:} Calculate the profit per bag by multiplying the selling price by the profit percentage.
    \item \textit{Output:} \$25 profit per bag (since 25\% of \$100 is \$25)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} How many bags of flour were sold to make \$3,000 in profit?
    \item \textit{Input:} \$3,000 total profit, \$25 profit per bag
    \item \textit{Action:} Divide the total profit by the profit per bag to find the number of bags sold.
    \item \textit{Output:} 120 bags sold (since \$3,000 / \$25 per bag = 120 bags)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 3:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} Which answer choice corresponds to the number of bags sold?
    \item \textit{Input:} 120 bags sold, Answer Choices: (A) 12 (B) 16 (C) 24 (D) 30 (E) 40
    \item \textit{Action:} Identify the correct answer choice that matches the number of bags sold.
    \item \textit{Output:} None of the answer choices match the number of bags sold.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, among answer choices A through E, the answer is none of the provided options. There seems to be a mistake as none of the answer choices correspond to the correct number of bags sold based on the given information.

\paragraph{CoT}: To solve this problem, we need to determine how much profit the grocer makes on each bag of flour and then use that information to find out how many bags were sold to make a total profit of \$3,000.

\textbf{Step 1: Calculate the profit per bag.} \\
Since the grocer makes a 25\% profit on the selling price, we can calculate the profit per bag as follows:

\begin{align*}
\text{Profit per bag} &= 25\% \text{ of selling price} \\
\text{Profit per bag} &= 0.25 \times \$100 \\
\text{Profit per bag} &= \$25
\end{align*}

\textbf{Step 2: Calculate the number of bags sold.} \\
Now that we know the profit per bag is \$25, we can calculate the number of bags sold to make a total profit of \$3,000.

\begin{align*}
\text{Total profit} &= \text{Profit per bag} \times \text{Number of bags sold} \\
\$3,000 &= \$25 \times \text{Number of bags sold}
\end{align*}

To find the number of bags sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per bag:

\begin{align*}
\text{Number of bags sold} &= \frac{\$3,000}{\$25} \\
\text{Number of bags sold} &= 120
\end{align*}

However, 120 is not one of the answer choices provided, which means we need to re-evaluate our calculations.

Let's go back to the statement that the grocer makes a 25\% profit on the selling price. This means that the selling price includes both the cost price and the profit. If the selling price is \$100 and the profit is 25\% of this selling price, then the profit per bag is indeed \$25, as we calculated.

Now, let's re-calculate the number of bags sold using the correct profit per bag:

\begin{align*}
\text{Number of bags sold} &= \frac{\$3,000}{\$25} \\
\text{Number of bags sold} &= 120
\end{align*}

Since 120 is not among the answer choices, we need to check if we've made a mistake in interpreting the answer choices or the question itself. If the question and calculations are correct, then there might be an error in the answer choices provided. If this is the case, none of the answer choices (A) through (E) is correct.

Let's review the question one more time to ensure we haven't missed any details. The question states that the grocer makes a 25\% profit on the selling price for each bag of flour and sells each bag for \$100. Our calculation of the profit per bag at \$25 is correct, and so is our calculation of the number of bags sold to make a \$3,000 profit.

Therefore, it seems there is a discrepancy with the answer choices provided, as none of them match our calculation of 120 bags. If we must choose from the given options, we would have to conclude that none of them is correct. However, since this is not a standard outcome for such problems, it's possible that there is a misunderstanding or an error in the question or answer choices.

\subsection{Example 2}

\textit{Question}: Find 25/12*5 

\textit{Answer Choices}: (A) 2.5498 (B) 0.4167 (C) 3.3987 (D) 8.5497 (E) 5.6312

\textit{GT}: B

\paragraph{IAO}: \noindent
\textbf{Step 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} What is the product of $(\frac{25}{12})$ and 5?
    \item \textit{Input:} $(\frac{25}{12})$, 5
    \item \textit{Action:} Multiply $(\frac{25}{12})$ by 5.
    \item \textit{Output:} 
    $\frac{25}{12} \times 5 = \frac{25 \times 5}{12} = \frac{125}{12}$
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Step 2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} What is the decimal equivalent of 125/12?
    \item \textit{Input:} 125/12
    \item \textit{Action:} Divide 125 by 12.
    \item \textit{Output:} 10.4167
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Step 3:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} Which answer choice matches the output from Step 2?
    \item \textit{Input:} 10.4167, Answer Choices: (A) 2.5498 (B) 0.4167 (C) 3.3987 (D) 8.5497 (E) 5.6312
    \item \textit{Action:} Compare the output with the given answer choices.
    \item \textit{Output:} None of the answer choices match the output from Step 2.
\end{itemize}

It seems there might have been a mistake in the calculation or in the provided answer choices. Let's re-evaluate the calculation in Step 2 to ensure accuracy.

\noindent
\textbf{Step 4:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} What is the correct decimal equivalent of 125/12?
    \item \textit{Input:} 125/12
    \item \textit{Action:} Divide 125 by 12 using long division or a calculator.
    \item \textit{Output:} 10.4167 (confirmed)
\end{itemize}

Upon re-evaluation, the calculation is confirmed to be correct, but the output does not match any of the provided answer choices. It's possible that there is an error in the question or the answer choices. However, based on the calculation we've done, none of the answer choices (A) through (E) is correct.

Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the provided choices.

\paragraph{COT}: To solve the expression 
\[ \frac{25}{12} \times 5 \], follow these steps:

\textbf{Step 1: Simplify the expression by performing the multiplication.}

\[ \frac{25}{12} \times 5 = \frac{25 \times 5}{12} \]

\textbf{Step 2: Multiply the numerator.}

\[ \frac{25 \times 5}{12} = \frac{125}{12} \]

\textbf{Step 3: Divide 125 by 12 to get the decimal form.}

\[ 125 \div 12 = 10.4167 \]

\textbf{Step 4: Compare the result with the answer choices.}

The result, 10.4167, is not listed among the answer choices. It seems there might have been a mistake in the calculation. Let's try again.

\textbf{Step 1: Simplify the expression by performing the multiplication.}

\[ \frac{25}{12} \times 5 = \frac{25 \times 5}{12} \]

\textbf{Step 2: Multiply the numerator.}

\[ \frac{25 \times 5}{12} = \frac{125}{12} \]

\textbf{Step 3: Divide 125 by 12 to get the decimal form.}

\[ 125 \div 12 = 10 \text{ remainder } 5 \]

To express the remainder as a decimal, we divide 5 by 12:

\[ 5 \div 12 = 0.4167 \]

Adding this to the whole number part (10), we get:

\[ 10 + 0.4167 = 10.4167 \]

This result still does not match any of the answer choices. However, upon re-evaluating the answer choices, it seems that none of them are correct if the original expression was indeed 
\[ \frac{25}{12} \times 5 \]. It's possible that there might be a typo in the question or the answer choices.

Given the calculations we've performed, none of the answer choices (A) through (E) match the correct result of 10.4167. Therefore, it appears there is an error in the provided information.

\section{Errors from Date Understanding}
\subsection{Example 1}
\textit{Question}:2015 is coming in 36 hours. What is the date 24 hours later in MM/DD/YYYY? 

\textit{Answer Choices}: (A) 12/30/2014 (B) 01/01/2015 (C) 01/04/2015 (D) 12/30/2059 (E) 12/31/2014 (F) 01/09/2015 

\textit{GT}:  "A"

\paragraph{IAO}:
\noindent
\textbf{Step 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} What is the current date if 2015 is coming in 36 hours?
    \item \textit{Input:} 2015 is coming in 36 hours.
    \item \textit{Action:} Subtract 36 hours from the start of 2015 to find the current date.
    \item \textit{Output:} The current date is December 30, 2014.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
\textbf{Step 2:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} What is the date 24 hours after the current date?
    \item \textit{Input:} The current date is December 30, 2014.
    \item \textit{Action:} Add 24 hours to the current date to find the date 24 hours later.
    \item \textit{Output:} The date 24 hours later is December 31, 2014.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, among the answer choices A through F, the answer is (E) December 31, 2014.

\paragraph{COT}: If 2015 is coming in 36 hours, we can determine the current date by subtracting 36 hours from the start of 2015.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Since there are 24 hours in a day, 36 hours is equivalent to $1 \text{ day} + 12 \text{ hours}$.
\item The start of 2015 is at $00:00$ on January 1, 2015.
\item Subtracting $1$ day from January 1, 2015, takes us back to December 31, 2014.
\item Since we need to subtract $12$ more hours, and we are currently at $00:00$ on December 31, 2014, we would still be on December 31, 2014, because we are not going back an entire day, just $12$ hours into the previous day.
\end{enumerate}

So, the current date and time, 36 hours before 2015, is $12:00 \text{ (noon)}$ on December 31, 2014.

Now, we need to determine the date 24 hours later:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Adding $24$ hours to $12:00$ on December 31, 2014, will bring us to $12:00$ on January 1, 2015.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, among A through F, the answer is (B) $01/01/2015$.

\subsection{Example 2}
\textit{Question}:Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY? 

\textit{Answer Choices}: (A) 10/23/2019 (B) 11/02/2019 (C) 10/27/2019 (D) 11/01/2048 (E) 11/01/2019  

\textit{GT}:  "E"

\paragraph{IAO}: \noindent
\textbf{Step 1:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Subquestion:} \underline{What is the date 10 days before 11/12/2019?}
    \item \textit{Input:} The given date is 11/12/2019.
    \item \textit{Action:} Subtract 10 days from the given date.
    \item \textit{Output:} The date 10 days before 11/12/2019 is 11/02/2019.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Therefore, among A through E, the answer is (B) 11/02/2019.


\paragraph{COT}: To find the date 10 days before 11/12/2019, we need to subtract 10 days from that date.

\textbf{Step 1: Start with the given date:} 11/12/2019 (which is in MM/DD/YYYY format, meaning November 12, 2019).

\textbf{Step 2: Subtract 10 days from the 12th of November.} Since $12 - 10 = 2$, if November had more than 2 days, we would end up in November itself. However, since we're subtracting more days than there are in the month up to the 12th, we need to go back to the previous month, which is October.

\textbf{Step 3: October has 31 days.} To find out what date it would be 10 days before November 12, we need to count back from October 31.

\textbf{Step 4: Since we need to go back 10 days from November 12, and there are only 1 day of November included in this count (November 12 itself), we subtract the remaining 9 days from the total number of days in October.}

\textbf{Step 5:} $31 \text{ (total days in October)} - 9 \text{ (days to subtract)} = 22$.

\textbf{Step 6: Therefore, 10 days before November 12, 2019, would be October 22, 2019.}

\textbf{Step 7: Convert this date into MM/DD/YYYY format, which gives us 10/22/2019.}

However, none of the answer choices match this date. It seems there might be a mistake in the answer choices provided or in the calculation. Let's double-check the calculation:

\textbf{Given date:} 11/12/2019

\textbf{Subtract 10 days:}

* November has 12 days up to and including the 12th.
* We need to subtract 10 days.
* $12 - 10 = 2$, so we would be at November 2nd if we didn't need to go into the previous month.
* But since we're subtracting 10 days, we do need to go into the previous month.
* October has 31 days, so the day before November 1st is October 31st.
* We've already accounted for 1 day in November, so we subtract 1 from 10, leaving us with 9 days to subtract from October 31st.
* $31 - 9 = 22$, so we end up on October 22nd.

Upon re-evaluating the calculation, the correct date is indeed October 22, 2019, which is not listed in the answer choices. It seems there may be a typo in the question or the answer choices. However, based on the calculation, the correct answer is not present in the options provided.

\textbf{Therefore, among A through E, the answer is none of the above.}

\section{Errors from StrategyQA}
\subsection{Example 1}
\textit{Question}: Would John Muir not likely have a vitamin D deficiency? 

\textit{GT}:  "yes"

\paragraph{IAO}: To determine whether John Muir would likely have a vitamin D deficiency, we need to consider factors that influence vitamin D levels, such as exposure to sunlight, diet, skin pigmentation, age, geographic location, and lifestyle. Since we don't have specific information about John Muir's personal details, we'll have to rely on general knowledge about his life and activities.

John Muir (1838--1914) was a Scottish-American naturalist, author, environmental philosopher, and early advocate for the preservation of wilderness in the United States. He spent a significant amount of time outdoors, particularly in places like Yosemite and other parts of the American West.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Step 1:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} Did John Muir spend a significant amount of time outdoors?
        \item \textit{Input:} Historical knowledge about John Muir's life and activities.
        \item \textit{Action:} Assess the likelihood of outdoor activity based on known biographical information.
        \item \textit{Output:} Yes, John Muir spent a significant amount of time outdoors.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 2:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} Does spending a significant amount of time outdoors increase exposure to sunlight?
        \item \textit{Input:} General knowledge about outdoor activities and sunlight exposure.
        \item \textit{Action:} Correlate outdoor activity with sunlight exposure.
        \item \textit{Output:} Yes, spending a significant amount of time outdoors generally increases exposure to sunlight.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 3:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} Does increased exposure to sunlight affect vitamin D levels?
        \item \textit{Input:} Scientific knowledge about vitamin D synthesis.
        \item \textit{Action:} Relate sunlight exposure to vitamin D synthesis.
        \item \textit{Output:} Yes, increased exposure to sunlight typically leads to higher vitamin D levels due to the skin's production of vitamin D in response to UVB rays.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 4:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} Based on John Muir's outdoor activities and the relationship between sunlight exposure and vitamin D synthesis, is it likely that John Muir had a vitamin D deficiency?
        \item \textit{Input:} Outputs from Step 1, Step 2, and Step 3.
        \item \textit{Action:} Infer the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency based on the correlation between outdoor activity, sunlight exposure, and vitamin D synthesis.
        \item \textit{Output:} It is unlikely that John Muir had a vitamin D deficiency given his significant time spent outdoors and the resulting increased exposure to sunlight.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is No.

\paragraph{COT}: \textbf{Step 1: Identify the factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency.}

Vitamin D deficiency can be caused by several factors, including:

\begin{itemize}
\item Lack of exposure to sunlight
\item Inadequate dietary intake of vitamin D
\item Certain medical conditions
\item The body's inability to absorb or convert vitamin D to its active form
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step 2: Consider John Muir's lifestyle.}

John Muir was a naturalist, explorer, and advocate for the preservation of wilderness.  His lifestyle involved spending a significant amount of time outdoors, often in sunny environments like California's Sierra Nevada mountains.

\textbf{Step 3: Assess the likelihood of vitamin D deficiency based on lifestyle.}

Given that John Muir spent a lot of time outdoors, he would have been exposed to sunlight regularly. Sunlight exposure is a primary source of vitamin D, as the body synthesizes vitamin D when the skin is exposed to UV rays from the sun.

\textbf{Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the information.}

Since John Muir was frequently outdoors and exposed to sunlight, it is \emph{less likely} that he would have suffered from vitamin D deficiency due to lack of sunlight exposure.

\textbf{Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is No.}

\textit{Question}: Can French Defence initial move defend against four move checkmate? 

\textit{GT}:  "no"

\paragraph{IAO}: To determine if the French Defence can defend against the four-move checkmate (also known as the Scholar's Mate), we need to analyze the moves involved in both the French Defence and the Scholar's Mate.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Step 1:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} What are the typical opening moves for the French Defence?
        \item \textit{Input:} The French Defence is a chess opening characterized by the moves.
        \item \textit{Action:} Describe the typical opening moves for the French Defence.
        \item \textit{Output:} The French Defence typically begins with 1.e4 e6.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 2:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} What are the moves involved in the four-move checkmate?
        \item \textit{Input:} The four-move checkmate (Scholar's Mate) sequence.
        \item \textit{Action:} Describe the typical sequence of moves that lead to the four-move checkmate.
        \item \textit{Output:} The four-move checkmate typically involves the moves 1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Qxf7\#.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 3:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} Can the opening move of the French Defence prevent the specific sequence of the four-move checkmate?
        \item \textit{Input:} The opening move of the French Defence (1.e4 e6) and the sequence of the four-move checkmate (1.e4 e5 2.Qh3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Nf6 4.Qxf7\#).
        \item \textit{Action:} Compare the opening moves of the French Defence with the moves required for the four-move checkmate to determine if the French Defence can prevent the checkmate sequence.
        \item \textit{Output:} The French Defence does not play 1...e5, which is a necessary move for the four-move checkmate. Instead, it plays 1...e6, which already deviates from the Scholar's Mate sequence.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Step 4:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Subquestion:} Does the deviation from the four-move checkmate sequence inherently prevent the checkmate from occurring?
        \item \textit{Input:} The deviation in the opening move of the French Defence from the Scholar's Mate sequence.
        \item \textit{Action:} Analyze the impact of the deviation on the possibility of the four-move checkmate occurring.
        \item \textit{Output:} Since the French Defence does not follow the move 1...e5, it inherently prevents the specific sequence of the four-move checkmate from occurring.
    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}

Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is Yes.

\paragraph{COT}: The Four-Move Checkmate, also known as the Scholar's Mate, is a quick checkmate that White can deliver after the following moves:

\begin{enumerate}
\item e4 e5
\item Qh5 Nc6
\item Bc4 Nf6
\item Qxf7\#
\end{enumerate}

In this sequence, White aims to attack the f7 square, which is a weak point in Black's position because it is only defended by the king at the beginning of the game.

The French Defense, on the other hand, is a chess opening that begins with the moves:

\begin{enumerate}
\item e4 e6
\end{enumerate}

The idea behind the French Defense is to solidify Black's position and create a strong pawn chain that can later be used to counterattack White's center. The French Defense does not immediately contest the e5 square, which is a key component of setting up the Scholar's Mate.

Let's see if the French Defense can prevent the Four-Move Checkmate:

\begin{enumerate}
\item e4 e6
\item d4 d5
\end{enumerate}

With the second move d5, Black challenges White's center and opens lines for the bishop and queen, which can help in defending against early threats.

If White tries to set up the Scholar's Mate anyway:

\begin{enumerate}
\item 3. Qh5
\end{enumerate}

Black can now defend easily because the move ...e6 has already prevented the bishop from coming to c4 to attack the f7 square. Black has several reasonable moves here, such as ...Nf6, which attacks the invading queen and prepares to castle, or even ...g6, which would force the queen to move again.

Since the French Defense does not allow White to establish the same attacking pattern as in the Scholar's Mate, it effectively prevents the quick checkmate.

\textbf{Therefore, the answer (Yes or No) is Yes.}
