\begin{abstract}
Today's open vocabulary scene graph generation (OVSGG) extends traditional SGG by recognizing novel objects and relationships beyond predefined categories, leveraging the knowledge from pre-trained large-scale models. Most existing methods adopt a two-stage pipeline: $\!$weakly supervised pre-training with image captions and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fully annotated scene graphs. Nonetheless, they omit explicit modeling of \textit{interacting objects} and treat all objects \textit{equally}, resulting in mismatched relation pairs. $\!$To this end, we propose an interaction-aware OVSGG framework INOVA. During pre-training, INOVA employs an interaction-aware target generation strategy to distinguish interacting objects from non-interacting ones. In SFT, INOVA devises an interaction-guided query selection tactic to prioritize interacting objects during bipartite graph matching. $\!$Besides, INOVA is equipped with an interaction-consistent knowledge distillation to enhance the robustness by pushing interacting object pairs away from the background. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks (VG and GQA) show that INOVA achieves state-of-the-art performance, demonstrating the potential of interaction-aware mechanisms for real-world applications.

% 2019 and 2021 and by Csaba Szepesvari, Gang Niu and Sivan Sabato in 2022.
% Modified again in 2023 and 2024 by Sivan Sabato and Jonathan Scarlett.
% Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias

% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
