\section{Conclusion}

This work presents an interaction-aware framework INOVA for OVSGG. Unlike previous works that treat all objects equally, INOVA emphasizes the distinction between interacting and non-interacting objects, which is crucial for exact relation recognition. By adopting interaction-aware target generation, interaction-guided query selection, and interaction-consistent knowledge distillation, INOVA effectively mitigates issues like mismatched relation pairs and irrelevant object interference. INOVA shows significant improvements across two mainstream OVSGG benchmarks. We anticipate that INOVA will not only set a new standard for OVSGG but also inspire further exploration of interaction-driven methodologies in VLMs for more accurate scene understanding.
