\section*{Impact Statement}
This paper presents work whose goal is to improve open-vocabulary scene graph generation. While our method, INOVA, focuses on technical advancements in introducing interaction-aware mechanisms, we acknowledge the broader implications of such technology. Enhanced scene graph generation could enable more robust applications in areas like assistive technologies, autonomous systems, and content-based image retrieval. However, as with many ML systems, biases in training data or deployment contexts could propagate unintended societal effects. We encourage future work to rigorously evaluate fairness and robustness when applying such models in critical domains.
