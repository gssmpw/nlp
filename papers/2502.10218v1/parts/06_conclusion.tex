\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this work an approach for using the Sphinx simulator by Parrot Drone to accurately simulate drones within more general Gazebo-based multi-robot simulation  frameworks is described. Furthermore, against the background of common tracking tasks, two controller frameworks are introduced to solve limitations present in the existing  PID-based controller framework provided by Parrot Drone in the Anafi firmware. Our first controller framework is also PID-based, however, suffers from limited tracking accuracy. For this purpose, our second control framework is an MPC which specifically aims to reduce the tracking error using a modified dynamics model with integral error states. The integration of the Anafi drone is tested using our airship simulation \cite{price2022} and the controllers are rigorously evaluated in simulation and real world experiments featuring different scenarios.
