\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we considered an important online optimization problem, single auto-bidding  under strict ROSC, and 
characterized the performance of any online algorithm. For the case when the valuation can be different for different slots, we showed an impossibility result that no online algorithm can achieve 
a sub-linear regret, which is a bit surprising. Having closed the door on obtaining a sub-linear regret, we consequently considered the weaker metric of 
competitive ratio and showed that a simple algorithm can achieve a competitive ratio close to one-half. With strict ROSC, we showed that the problem is non-trivial
even if the valuation remains constant across time slots, and derived an algorithm with almost tight regret guarantees for a class of inputs.
