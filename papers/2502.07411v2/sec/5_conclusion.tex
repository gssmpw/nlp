% To provide a testing ground to evaluate model capacity and develop new techniques for
To provide a benchmark for research on egocentric scene-text aware QA assistance, we carefully construct the \dataset~dataset. \dataset~highlights QA assistance involving scene text from an ego-perspective in diverse real-life scenarios, including outdoor driving and indoor house-keeping. The questions reflect the real user needs, yet the visual attention is often not focused on the scene text. With well-classified visual scenarios and question types, we comprehensively analyze models that excel on existing scene-text VQA benchmarks and find that they struggle on \dataset. We further explore heuristic solutions and provide insights for improvements,
With these efforts, we hope this work can complement existing VideoQA research in advancing real-life egocentric QA assistance.
