\section{Empirical Ablation Study} \label{sec:ablation}

In this section, we empirically evaluate the performance of our proposed ForM model through a series of ablation experiments. We begin by illustrating the Spiral dataset and the corresponding transport objective, where samples are moved from the distribution $\pi_0$ ({\textbf{blue}}) to $\pi_1$ ({\textbf{pink}}) (see Figure~\ref{fig:spiral_dataset}). We then compare three approaches: the baseline Flow matching method using solely the first-order term (O1), an enhanced variant that integrates both first-order and second-order loss metrics (O1 + O2), and our ForM model that leverages the Lorentz force to guide trajectory evolution. Qualitative results are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:onedot}, while Table~\ref{tab:euclidean_distance_complex_datasets_new} quantitatively demonstrates the superior performance of the ForM model.
