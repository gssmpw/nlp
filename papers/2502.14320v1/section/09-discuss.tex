\jing{Janus maintains a warm pod pool to decrease the impact of cold start.
Despite its simplicity, this pool may inevitably compromise resource efficiency.
Additionally, Janus may exhibit sub-optimal resource adaptation for dynamic workflows with uncertain execution paths.
This uncertainty exacerbates the dependencies of adaptation decisions (as detailed in \S\ref{sec:bg:adaptive-allocation}), potentially leading to sub-optimal adaptation especially for functions shared across different paths.}
