\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we present a tightly-coupled 4D-radar-inertial odometry framework. By employing uncertainty-aware ground filtering, we effectively eliminate the inherent noises from radar. Continuous velocity preintegration via \ac{GP} effectively mitigates temporal discrepancies between radar and \ac{IMU}, and enables robust motion estimation directly from the asynchronous measurements without any assumptions.
% Additionally, spatial information is incorporated through cluster-based weighted scan matching.
We have demonstrated that our method outperforms existing 4D radar-inertial odometry algorithms in terms of precision and resilience across various scenarios through the public datasets.
Notably, the proposed algorithm achieves substantially enhanced vertical odometry accuracy.

Despite significant advancements, minor challenges remain. Since our filtering process primarily targets underground noise, horizontal multipath remains a concern. For future work, we aim to incorporate vertical plane modeling to enhance the robustness of the odometry and mapping system. Also, we plan to improve our system by developing a comprehensive bias model for the IMU gyroscope or incorporating the accelerometer measurements.
