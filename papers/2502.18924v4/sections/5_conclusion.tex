\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we introduce MegaTTS 3, a zero-shot TTS framework that leverages novel sparse alignment boundaries to ease the difficulty of alignment learning while retaining the naturalness of the generated speeches. This strategy allows MegaTTS 3 to combine the strengths of methods with both implicit alignments and predefined hard alignments. Additionally, we employ the PeRFlow technique to further accelerate the generation process and design a multi-condition CFG strategy to offer more flexible control over accents. Experimental results show that MegaTTS 3 achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS speech quality while maintaining a more efficient pipeline. Moreover, the sparse alignment strategy also shows enhanced prosodic naturalness and higher robustness against a suboptimal duration predictor. Due to space constraints, further discussions are provided in the appendix.
