	abstract = {We propose a conceptually simple and lightweight framework for deep reinforcement learning that uses asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers. We present asynchronous variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input.},

Particularly, in order to control unauthorized drones, the systems to detect and track drones have to be developed. In this paper, we propose the drone position tracking system using multiple Bluetooth low energy (BLE) receivers. The proposed system first estimates the target's location, which consists of the distance and angle, while using the received signal strength indication (RSSI) signals at four BLE receivers and gradually tracks the target based on the estimated distance and angle. We propose two tracking algorithms, depending on the estimation method and also apply the memory process, improving the tracking performance by using stored previous movement information. We evaluate the proposed system's performance in terms of the average number of movements that are required to track and the tracking success rate.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) have many applications in both commerce and recreation. However, irresponsibly operated UAVs will pose a threat to public safety. Therefore, developing our understanding of UAVs and their uses is of particular interest. This paper considers tracking UAVs, which provide multifaceted information around location, paths and trajectories. To facilitate research on this topic, we introduce a new benchmark, herein referred to as Anti-UAV, which provides a novel direction for UAV tracking with more than 300 video pairs containing over 580 k manually annotated bounding boxes. Addressing anti-UAV research challenges could help to design anti-UAV systems, which in turn may improve surveillance. Accordingly, we have proposed a simple yet effective approach, called dual-flow semantic consistency (DFSC) is proposed for UAV tracking. Modulated by the semantic flow across video sequences, tracker learns more robust class-level semantic information and obtains more discriminative instance-level features. Experiments highlight significant performance gain with the proposed approach over state-of-the-art trackers and the challenging aspects of Anti-UAV. The Anti-UAV benchmark and the code for the proposed approach have been made publicly available at https://github.com/ucas-vg/Anti-UAV and https://github.com/ZhaoJ9014/Anti-UAV .},

@article{Li2022,
	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is being increasingly used in a wide variety of applications ranging from remote sensing, to delivery and security. As the number of UAVs increases, there is a growing need for UAV to UAV detection and tracking systems for both collision avoidance and coordination. Among possible solutions, autonomous ``see-and-avoid'' systems based on low-cost high-resolution video cameras offer important advantages in terms of light weight and low power consumption. However, in order to be effective, camera based ``see-and-avoid'' systems require sensitive, robust, and computationally efficient algorithms for autonomous detection and tracking of UAVs from a moving camera. In this article, we propose a general architecture for a highly accurate and computationally efficient UAV to UAV detection and tracking (U2U-D&T) algorithm from a camera mounted on a moving UAV platform. The system is based on a computationally efficient pipeline consisting of a moving target detector, followed by a target tracker. The algorithm is validated using video data collected from multiple fixed-wing UAVs that is manually ground-truthed and is publicly available. Results indicate that the proposed algorithm can be implemented on commodity hardware and robustly achieves highly accurate detection and tracking of even distant and faint UAVs. Open source code for the U2U-D&T algorithm is available at: https://github.com/jingliinpurdue/Fast-and-Robust-UAV-to-UAV-Detection-and-Tracking.git.},

@article{Li2023a,
	abstract = {With the high computation efficiency and tracking accuracy, discriminative correlation filters (DCFs) have been applied to unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) tracking. However, in the scenarios (i.e., complex background and temporary occlusion), DCF-based trackers usually generate low credibility response under the influence of background distractors, which contains multiple side peaks and declines the tracking performance. Motivated by the response consistency in adjacent frames and background information penalization, we propose learning a response interference suppression (RIS) CF to tackle this problem. Specifically, we introduce an RIS regularization into the DCF-based framework, which aims to keep the target area response consistent in adjacent frames and repress distractors' response in the background. Besides, we adopt a response auxiliary strategy (RAS) to smooth the target response, which intends to obtain the precise location and avoid target drift. Furthermore, extensive experiments on three UAV benchmarks demonstrate the excellent performance of the proposed method against other 19 state-of-the-art trackers. Moreover, the tracking speed of the proposed method can reach ∼ 42 frames/s (FPS) on a single CPU.},

The powers and bandwidths of these positioning signals are controllable, which reduces the near-far effect, and improves the range measurement accuracy. Other major contributions are: we analyze the interference of the positioning signal to the communication one; we give the lower-bound and measurement accuracy of the range estimation in both flat and fading channels, and derive their simple expressions. The results show the interaction between the communication and positioning signals is limited, and it is feasible to use the proposed signal for high accuracy positioning.},
