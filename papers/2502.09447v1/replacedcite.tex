\subsection{Datasets for Reasoning Segmentation}
\vspace{-5pt}
Current reasoning segmentation datasets ____ mainly focus on region-level segmentation and single-step reasoning, which fail to meet the comprehensive requirements of the pixel-level RS task.
Traditional region-level segmentation datasets ____ rely on simple and explicit instructions, lacking complex user intents understanding. To bridge this gap, ReasonSeg ____ is the first to propose a segmentation dataset based on complex queries, which is a small scale and does not support multi-turn interactions. While recent datasets ____ have expanded in size and diversity, they remain focused on multi-object segmentation and provide limitations for multi-step reasoning and fine-grained grounding. In contrast, our PRIST dataset utilizes conversation to simulate a human-like multi-step reasoning process, which innovatively combines multi-turn reasoning with pixel-level segmentation. %PRIST provides a new solution for reasoning segmentation tasks. 
Detailed dataset comparisons are shown in Table \ref{tab:compare_benchmark} in Appendix \ref{dataappendix}.

\subsection{MLLMs for Region-level Segmentation} 
\vspace{-5pt}
MLLMs have advanced vision-language perception tasks, with recent works 
____ focusing on image-level visual dialogue. Some ____ achieve region-level understanding by incorporating positional information and boundary boxes, mainly relying on LLMs for region interpretation. Several models ____ integrate segmentation-specific modules with LLMs for end-to-end training, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of regions. While these methods address pixel-level grounding, they still face limitations in complex reasoning. More comparison between models in Appendix \ref{sec:compare}. Our proposed MIRAS overcomes these challenges by enhancing segmentation accuracy through interactive reasoning, progressively refining the boundaries.
