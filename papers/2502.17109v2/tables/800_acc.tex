\caption{Simulation counts = 800, This table illustrates the accuracy of predicting human moves using three different methods:
Policy: This method directly outputs the move with the highest policy value without any search. As a result, its playing strength is lower than any MCTS method that incorporates win rate searching. Interestingly, we observe that when the model is trained across various skill levels simultaneously, it performs best when predicting moves at the average skill level (highest accuracy at 3D and 5D levels).
MCTS: This method employs the original PUCT formula for Monte Carlo Tree Search, allowing it to achieve a level surpassing that of a 9D player. We also observe that the accuracy of MCTS in predicting moves increases as the skill level being emulated becomes stronger. In other words, stronger human players have a higher likelihood of making moves similar to top-level AI.
SSA and BT-MCTS: Both SSA and BT-MCTS are methods for adjusting the program's skill level. Since SSA does not directly correspond to skill level, we conducted matches between SSA and our BT-MCTS program (which we have successfully trained to the level of a 5-dan player through matches on platforms like Fox-Weiqi) to find the temperature that closely matches each skill level (with approximately 50\% win rate), and used it for move prediction accuracy evaluation.
Although SSA can adjust skill levels through temperature adjustment, it exhibits the lowest accuracy among the three methods, even lower than the original MCTS. However, through our method (BT-MCTS), not only can we successfully adjust to various skill levels, but we also achieve higher accuracy than the original MCTS, accomplishing both strong playing strength and moves resembling those of the respective skill level players.}
