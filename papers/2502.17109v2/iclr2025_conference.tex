% If the main focus of your paper is on the methodology, the challenges of design, and the innovative aspects of creating the system, then "Designing a Go System" might be more appropriate as it highlights the process and development.
% If the paper is more about the application, effectiveness, and specific functionality of the completed system within the context of Go, then "A System Designed for Go" is likely better as it emphasizes the systemâ€™s tailored utility and readiness for use.

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to \LaTeX{} to determine where to break
% the lines. Using \AND forces a linebreak at that point. So, if \LaTeX{}
% puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last on the second
% line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third author name.
