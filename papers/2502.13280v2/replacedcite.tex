SDE-based samplers, such as PIS ____, DIS ____, DDS ____, and ____, inherently possess rich interpretation to the optimal control problem. Although discussed theoretically, the connection to optimal control is rarely exploited directly. 

% normalizing flows
% FAB ____ uses normalizing flow with AIS to train a sampler.
% DiKL ____ trains an implicit generator by matching the spread divergence between the model and the target.

Sequentially drawing intermediate samples from a series of distributions that interpolate between the initial and target distributions is a recurring strategy in sampling. Classical sampling methods, such as SMC ____ and AIS ____, generate intermediate samples from tempered distributions.
More recent works explore the use of diffused target densities as intermediate distributions. However, a key challenge in this setting is that the score of diffused densities cannot be estimated using the same techniques in diffusion modeling ____. To address this, various approaches have been proposed, leveraging different mathematical formulations ____. VGS addresses the same challenge but with the toolbox of RL, as the value function is theoretically linked to the log of the diffused target density.
