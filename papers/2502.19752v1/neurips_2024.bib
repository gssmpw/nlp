    abstract = "Real-world applications of language models entail data privacy constraints when learning from diverse data domains. Federated learning with pretrained language models for language tasks has been gaining attention lately but there are definite confounders that warrants a careful study. Specifically, understanding the limits of federated NLP applications through varying the effects of different aspects (such as data heterogeneity, the trade-off between training time and performance, the effect of different data, and client distributions and sensitivity of the shared model to learning local distributions) is necessary to evaluate whether language models indeed learn to generalize by adapting to the different domains. Towards that, we elaborate different hypotheses over the components in federated NLP architectures and study them in detail with relevant experiments over three tasks: Stanford Sentiment Treebank-2, OntoNotes-5.0 and GigaWord. The experiments with different Transformer inductive biases on the variety of tasks provide a glimpse at the understanding of federated learning at NLP tasks. Specifically, the analysis suggests that regularization due to the ensembling effect may be masquerading as domain adaptation of federated learning in NLP with pre-trained language models.",

    abstract = "Despite the versatility of pre-trained language models (PLMs) across domains, their large memory footprints pose significant challenges in federated learning (FL), where the training model has to be distributed between a server and clients. One potential solution to bypass such constraints might be the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in the context of FL. However, we have observed that typical PEFT tends to severely suffer from heterogeneity among clients in FL scenarios, resulting in unstable and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose Client-Customized Adaptation (C2A), a novel hypernetwork-based FL framework that generates client-specific adapters by conditioning the client information. With the effectiveness of the hypernetworks in generating customized weights through learning to adopt the different characteristics of inputs, C2A can maximize the utility of shared model parameters while minimizing the divergence caused by client heterogeneity. To verify the efficacy of C2A, we perform extensive evaluations on FL scenarios involving heterogeneity in label and language distributions. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of C2A in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness in FL scenarios.",

abstract = { Federated learning provides a privacy guarantee for generating good deep learning models on distributed clients with different kinds of data. Nevertheless, dealing with non-IID data is one of the most challenging problems for federated learning. Researchers have proposed a variety of methods to eliminate the negative influence of non-IIDness. However, they only focus on the non-IID data provided that the universal class distribution is balanced. In many real-world applications, the universal class distribution is long-tailed, which causes the model seriously biased. Therefore, this paper studies the joint problem of non-IID and long-tailed data in federated learning and proposes a corresponding solution called Federated Ensemble Distillation with Imbalance Calibration (FEDIC). To deal with non-IID data, FEDIC uses model ensemble to take advantage of the diversity of models trained on non-IID data. Then, a new distillation method with logit adjustment and calibration gating network is proposed to solve the long-tail problem effectively. We evaluate FEDIC on CIFAR-10-LT, CIFAR-100-LT, and ImageNet-LT with a highly non-IID experimental setting, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods of federated learning and long-tail learning.
