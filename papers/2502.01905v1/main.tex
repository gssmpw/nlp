\begin{abstract}
We explore the influence maximisation problem in networks with negative ties. Where prior work has focused on unsigned networks, we investigate the need to consider negative ties in networks while trying to maximise spread in a population \textemdash particularly under competitive conditions. Given a signed network we optimise the strategies of a focal controller against competing influence in the network using two approaches \textemdash either the focal controller uses a sign-agnostic approach or they factor in the sign of the edges while optimising their strategies. We compare the difference in vote-shares (or the share of population) obtained by both these methods to determine the need to navigate negative ties in these settings.
More specifically, we study the impact of: (a) network topology, (b) resource conditions and (c) competitor strategies on the difference in vote shares obtained across both methodologies. We observe that gains are maximum when resources available to the focal controller are low and the competitor avoids negative edges in their strategy. Conversely, gains are insignificant irrespective of resource conditions when the competitor targets the network indiscriminately.
Finally, we study the problem in a game-theoretic setting, where we simultaneously optimise the strategies of both competitors. Interestingly we observe that, strategising with the knowledge of negative ties can occasionally also lead to loss in vote-shares.
