\textbf{Self-Referential Self-Improving Systems.} Numerous frameworks \citep{yuan2024evoagent, evomac, adas, comfybench, godel} have been proposed to address the design of multi-agent scaffolding. EvoAgent \citep{yuan2024evoagent} extends single expert agents to multi-agent scaffolds via evolutionary algorithms, whilst \textsc{AgentBreeder} evolves the entire system as a unit. EvoMAC \citep{evomac} evolves agents and their connections during test time to improve code generation, whereas \textsc{AgentBreeder} is domain agnostic and can explore the entire search space of scaffolds. ADAS \citep{adas}, ComfyAgent \citep{comfybench} and GÃ¶del Agent \citep{godel} search in the space of code for novel scaffolds, but unlike \textsc{AgentBreeder} they do not incorporate a quality-diversity mechanism for exploring agent design space. FunSearch \citep{funsearch} is an evolutionary method to search the function space for high-performing computer programs but not necessarily scaffolds. PromptBreeder \citep{promptbreeder} is an evolutionary self-improving framework that evolves prompts for a given domain, but does not focus on the scaffold as a whole.

\textbf{Multi-Agent Safety Research.} \citet{psysafe} evaluate the safety of multi-agent scaffolds from a psychological perspective by injecting agents with malicious traits, and provide mitigation strategies such as performing psychological assessments and therapy for agents. Polaris \citep{polaris} introduces a safety-focused scaffold for real-time patient healthcare conversations.
\citet{maliciouserrormultiagentsystems} explore the resilience of multi-agent scaffolds when injected with malicious or error-prone agents. \citet{scaffoldedllms} provide a more thorough discussion of the safety risks associated with scaffolded LLMs.
