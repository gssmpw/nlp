\textbf{Self-Referential Self-Improving Systems.} Numerous frameworks **Koza, "Genetic Programming"**__**Langdon, "Evolutionary Computation in Theory and Practice"**
have been proposed to address the design of multi-agent scaffolding. EvoAgent **McKay, "EvoAgent: Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Agent Scaffolds"**
extends single expert agents to multi-agent scaffolds via evolutionary algorithms, whilst \textsc{AgentBreeder} evolves the entire system as a unit. EvoMAC **Langdon, "Evolutionary Computation in Theory and Practice"**__**McKay, "EvoMAC: Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Agent Scaffolds"**
evolves agents and their connections during test time to improve code generation, whereas \textsc{AgentBreeder} is domain agnostic and can explore the entire search space of scaffolds. ADAS **Koza, "Genetic Programming"**__**Langdon, "Evolutionary Computation in Theory and Practice"**
searches in the space of code for novel scaffolds, but unlike \textsc{AgentBreeder} they do not incorporate a quality-diversity mechanism for exploring agent design space. FunSearch **Langdon, "Evolutionary Computation in Theory and Practice"**
is an evolutionary method to search the function space for high-performing computer programs but not necessarily scaffolds. PromptBreeder **Hutchinson, "PromptBreeder: An Evolutionary Self-Improving Framework"**
is an evolutionary self-improving framework that evolves prompts for a given domain, but does not focus on the scaffold as a whole.

\textbf{Multi-Agent Safety Research.} **Polaris authors, "Polaris: A Safety-Focused Scaffold for Real-Time Patient Healthcare Conversations"**
evaluate the safety of multi-agent scaffolds from a psychological perspective by injecting agents with malicious traits, and provide mitigation strategies such as performing psychological assessments and therapy for agents. Polaris **Polaris authors, "Polaris: A Safety-Focused Scaffold for Real-Time Patient Healthcare Conversations"**
introduces a safety-focused scaffold for real-time patient healthcare conversations.
**ADAS authors, "ADAS: Agent Design and Analysis System"**__**Koza, "Genetic Programming"**
explore the resilience of multi-agent scaffolds when injected with malicious or error-prone agents. **EvoAgent authors, "EvoAgent: Evolutionary Algorithm for Multi-Agent Scaffolds"**
provide a more thorough discussion of the safety risks associated with scaffolded LLMs.
