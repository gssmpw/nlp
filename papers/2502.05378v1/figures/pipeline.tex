    \caption{\textbf{Overview of the proposed next-best-path (NBP) framework.} 
    The model (left, see Section~\ref{sec:method_model}) predicts a value map of coverage gain and an obstacle map, which are used for decision making (right, see Section~\ref{sec:method_decisionmaking}) to obtain a next-best path.
    %Given the current estimate of the surroundings of the agent, we predict the total surface coverage gains after travelling to locations and orientations within a large neighbourhood centered on the agent and an obstacle map for computing the shortest paths towards these locations. See the text for more explanations.
