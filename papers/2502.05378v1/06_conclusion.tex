\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we tackle the challenging problem of active 3D mapping of unknown environments.
We introduce a new dataset, AiMDoom, designed to benchmark active mapping in indoor scenes with four difficulty levels. Our evaluations of existing methods on the AiMDoom dataset reveal shortcomings of short-sighted next-best-view prediction in complex large indoor environments.
Hence, we propose the next-best-path (NBP) method, which integrates a mapping progress encoder, a coverage gain decoder and an obstacle map decoder. The NBP model can efficiently reconstruct unseen environments guided by predicted long-term goals, achieving state-of-the-art performance on both the MP3D and AiMDoom datasets. 
However, we observe considerable room for improvement in more difficult levels of our dataset, and the major limitation lies in long-term goal prediction rather than obstacle map prediction.
