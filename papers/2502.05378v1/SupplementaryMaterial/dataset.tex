\section{Dataset}

\textbf{Dataset construction.} To ensure that each map offers full accessibility for various robotic platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and wheeled robots, we configure all doors and windows to remain open during map generation. 
However, we observe that Obsidian does not consistently guarantee accessibility to all areas. To resolve this, we manually edited each scene to ensure the traversability of windows, doors, and hidden passages.

\textbf{Dataset statistic.} To calculate navigation complexity, we sampled location pairs from four environments ranging in difficulty from simple to insane, at rates of 1\%, 0.1\%, 0.05\%, and 0.02\%, constrained by computational resource limitations. Consequently, our data effectively represents a lower bound of navigation complexity. Despite this conservative sampling approach, our dataset remains the most complex one, offering a significant challenge for future research.

Figure~\ref{fig:dataset_full} presents more examples of maps from our dataset, showcasing various levels and diverse scenarios.
