\begin{abstract}
Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and non-invasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography  (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)--based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pre-trained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5$\times$ the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over $3.5\times$ (from $13.73$ MB down to $3.83$ MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.

\indent \textit{Clinical relevance}—Our cuffless BP estimation framework addresses the limitations of traditional, intermittent cuff-based devices by exploiting common ECG and PPG signals, enabling more frequent and unobtrusive measurement. With EEG-based pre-training and hardware-friendly quantization, this approach holds promise for low-power, continuous BP monitoring in both clinical and home environments, potentially improving early detection of hypertension and related cardiovascular risks.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we demonstrated that a large transformer-based foundation model, originally trained on EEG, can be successfully adapted to estimate blood pressure from ECG and PPG with near-clinical accuracy. Using the CEReBrO model~\cite{CEReBrO} as our base, we achieved MAE as low as 1.57~mmHg (DBP) and 2.72~mmHg (SBP) on the MIMIC-III dataset, and 1.92~mmHg (DBP) and 3.14~mmHg (SBP) on VitalDB. These results fulfill critical benchmarks such as the BHS Grade~A and the AAMI guidelines, reinforcing the clinical viability of cross-biosignal knowledge transfer.

Beyond raw accuracy, we showed that post-training quantization substantially reduces the model footprint with minimal performance degradation. Dynamic quantization compressed the largest model from over $300$~MB to approximately $80$~MB—an almost $3.8\times$ reduction—while preserving MAE and \(R^2\) scores. This compression is vital for on-device, real-time BP monitoring in energy-constrained wearable systems, enabling more frequent and unobtrusive cardiovascular health assessments compared to traditional cuff-based devices.

Our findings underscore the promise of foundation models in biosignal processing and illustrate how quantization fosters practical deployment in low-resource or portable settings. Importantly, this work lays the groundwork for future research wherein the EEG-based foundation model not only serves as an effective tool for cross-biosignal transfer but also as a basis for developing dedicated ECG/PPG foundation models. Future work will explore additional compression methods such as pruning and distillation, integration of demographic factors for improved fairness, and further validation on embedded platforms to handle real-world artifacts and motion conditions. By combining efficient cross-biosignal transfer and hardware-friendly optimizations, this approach offers a path toward continuous, real-time blood pressure monitoring that can enhance patient care and clinical decision-making.
