Large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance by scaling model parameters, but this comes with significant inference overhead. 
Feed-forward networks (FFNs), which dominate LLM parameters, exhibit high activation sparsity in hidden neurons. 
To exploit this, researchers have proposed using a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture, where only a subset of parameters is activated. 
However, existing approaches often require extensive training data and resources, limiting their practicality.
We propose CMoE (Carved MoE), a novel framework to efficiently carve MoE models from dense models. 
CMoE achieves remarkable performance through efficient expert grouping and lightweight adaptation. 
First, neurons are grouped into shared and routed experts based on activation rates. 
Next, we construct a routing mechanism without training from scratch, incorporating a differentiable routing process and load balancing.
Using modest data, CMoE produces a well-designed, usable MoE from a 7B dense model within five minutes. With lightweight fine-tuning, it achieves high-performance recovery in under an hour.
