\section{Concluding Remarks}
We introduced a novel approach for the compositional verification of concurrent programs using past-time epistemic temporal logic. Using the expressiveness of this logic, we have established a sound framework that addresses the challenges of modularity and composability in verifying concurrent systems. Our methodology extends the seminal work of Halpern and Moses by incorporating past-time operators. The use of past-time temporal epistemic logic enables precise reasoning about the historical context of thread operations, which is crucial for ensuring the correctness of concurrent programs. Moreover, our proof system has been shown to be sound, providing a solid foundation for further research and potential extensions.
