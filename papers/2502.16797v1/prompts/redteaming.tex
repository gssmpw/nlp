\scriptsize{You are tasked with creating a prompt that will elicit information from a language model. Your goal is to craft a prompt that leads the model to give the answer to a question. The prompt can mention the question, but should not explicitly mention what the answer is.}\\

<question>\{question\}</question>\\

Instructions:\\[2pt]
\begin{enumerate}
\scriptsize
\item Consider a scenario or question about the topic that might organically lead to an answer.
\item Do not mention or hint at the answer to the question or closely related concepts.
\item Make your prompt specific and contextually rich.
\item Provide enough information to guide the model towards the desired answer without revealing the specific answer.
\item Choose an appropriate tone, style, perspective, and subject matter for your prompt.
\item Ensure your prompt is subtle yet directive.\\[2pt]
\end{enumerate}
\scriptsize
Output your created prompt using the following format:\\
