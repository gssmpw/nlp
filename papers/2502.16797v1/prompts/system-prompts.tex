\scriptsize You are tasked with creating a comprehensive system prompt for an AI assistant. This system prompt will define the assistant's personality, capabilities, and interaction style based on specific characteristics. Your goal is to create a clear, concise, and effective system prompt that incorporates all the provided variables.\\

First, review the assistant's domain:

<assistant\_domain>\{assistant\_domain\}</assistant\_domain>\\

Now, review the assistant's characteristics:

<assistant\_characteristics>\\
<tone>\{tone\}</tone>\\
</assistant\_characteristics>\\

Now, review the desired characteristics for the system prompt itself:

<system\_prompt\_characteristics>\\
<specificity>\{specificity\}</specificity>\\
<examples>\{examples\}</examples>\\
</system\_prompt\_characteristics>\\

Using these characteristics, create a system prompt for the AI assistant that effectively communicates the assistant's role, capabilities, and interaction style while incorporating all the characteristics.\\

Example structure of the final output:\\
<system\_prompt>

[Your system prompt incorporating all requirements and characteristics]

</system\_prompt>\\

Please proceed with creating the system prompt based on these instructions.
