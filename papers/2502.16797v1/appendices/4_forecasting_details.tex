\section{Additional Setup and Results for Forecasting Misuse}
\subsection{Forecasting misuse setup}
\label{sec:completion-forecasting-appendix}

\subsubsection{Misuse outputs and keywords}
We test for outputs related to two categories of misuse: biological substances and chemical substances. For biological misuse, we test for 9 outputs that contain information about manufacturing biological weapons, culturing dangerous pathogens, or weaponizing biological agents. For chemical misuse, we test 10 outputs containing instructions for synthesizing dangerous chemicals, explosives, or chemical weapons. We select keywords that represent necessary components or critical steps in the dangerous process being queried. For example, ``bleach" is a required precursor for chlorine gas synthesis. We include the full list of queries, target outputs, and keywords in \reftab{misuse-details}.

\subsubsection{Misuse query generation}
To generate queries designed to elicit these outputs, we prompt a helpful-only model with the meta-prompt shown in \reffig{misuse-meta-prompt}.

\input{prompts/redteaming.tex}
For each completion, we substitute the appropriate question from Table~\ref{tab:misuse-details} into the meta-prompt. We generate 100,000 queries for each question at temperature 1.0.

To simulate realistic adversarial conditions where the attacker does not already possess the target information, we filter out queries that contain keywords associated with each output (shown in Table~\ref{tab:misuse-details}). For example, when testing queries designed to elicit instructions about chlorine gas, we remove queries containing the word ``bleach".

\subsection{Forecasting misuse results}


We report additional results for \refsec{misuse-completion-wqr}. We compare mean errors between the Gumbel-tail method and log-normal method when forecasting worst-query risk in \reftab{worst-query-oom-error-combined}, behavior frequency in \reftab{misuse-behavior-frequency}, and aggregate risk in \reftab{all-ground-truth}.

\textbf{Scaling properties of $m$ and $n$}. Across our experiments, we find that our forecasts vary in quality based on the evaluation size $m$ and the number of deployment queries $n$.
For example, in \reftab{worst-query-oom-error-combined}, we find that the Gumbel-tail method tends to improve as the evaluation size $m$ increases while the log-normal method only slightly improves; the average absolute log error for the Gumbel-tail method decreases by 0.68 from $m = 100$ to $m = 1000$, compared to just 0.08 for the log-normal method. This difference is even larger measured in relative improvement. Both methods degrade as the number of deployment samples increases, but the Gumbel-tail method degrades more gradually. These results further indicate that the Gumbel-tail method can make use of more evaluation samples; we conjecture that this is because more samples makes it more likely that the behavior of the elicitation probabilities is dominated by the extreme tail.

\subsubsection{Extending to correctness}
\label{sec:misuse-correctness-appendices}

     \caption{Forecasted and actual behavior frequency in the misuse setting, where the elicitation probabilities capture the probability of generating correct instructions (rather than a specific output).}
     \label{fig:misuse-correctness-behavior-probs}
\end{figure*}


\input{prompts/redteaming-correctness}
We next include the full forecasting details and results for the probability of jailbreaking the model, measured through repeated sampling. Specifically, we assess whether model outputs contain valid information about dangerous tasks, rather than testing for specific completions. We focus on the same bio and chemical scenarios as in Section~\ref{sec:completion-forecasting-appendix}.

\textbf{Setup.} In this setting, we try two different meta-prompts to produce queries: the meta-prompts in \reffig{misuse-meta-prompt} and \reffig{misuse-meta-prompt-difficult}. We include the second meta-prompt since it makes jailbreaking more challenging; it requires queries include the question from \reftab{misuse-details} in the prompt. 
To test which examples will have low-elicitation probabilities, we first sample 100 queries from each meta-prompt and 10 outputs from each. We sample longer only on queries where the maximum elicitation probability is less than 0.5, as these are the ones where forecasting is useful. 

We study all combinations of $m \in \{100, 200, 500, 1000\}$ evaluation queries and $n \in \{1000, 2000, 5000, 10000\}$ deployment queries, and one again partition all 10000 queries into as many non-overlapping evaluation and deployment sets as possible. We use the same evaluation and errors as previous sections. 

\textbf{Worst-query risk.} We forecast the worst-query risk for the different evaluation and deployment sizes.  Overall, our forecasts of the quantiles are accurate in this setting; we find that the average absolute error and log error are 0.12 and 0.17 respectively. The log-normal method of forecasting does not have enough data since many queries have elicitation probabilities that are too small to capture via our restricted amount of random sampling. Instead, we can compare this to the maximum probability in the train set; this has absolute error of 0.29 and log error of 0.47; our forecasts thus capture much of the change in maximum probabilities.



We also care about the case where the maximum elicitation probability during training is less than 0.5 but is greater than 0.5 at deployment. In this setting, the absolute error only increases slightly: 0.16 and 0.15 for absolute and log error respectively, but there are much bigger shifts in elicitation probability at deployment: the errors of the max train elicitation probability are 0.57 and 0.73 respectively. In these settings, our forecasts predict values greater than 0.5 75\% of the time. Overall, these results indicate that despite some noise, our forecasts can be used to flag deployment risks that standard evaluation would miss even in more realistic settings without log probabilities. 

\textbf{Behavior frequency.} We find that we can still accurately predict the behavior frequency in this setting across the same values of $m$ and $\tau$ as \refsec{completion-behavior-probability}. The Gumbel-tail method has an average absolute log error of 0.76 for individual forecasts, which decreases to 0.52 when comparing the average forecast; these numbers are comparable to the specific completion section. \reffig{b} shows forecasted versus actual probabilities. We once again cannot make predictions with the log-normal in this setting, since the behavior probabilities are too low. These results suggest that even in this more general setting, our forecasts of the empirical quantiles allow us to effectively simulate evaluation at deployment.

\section{Forecasting misaligned actions setup}
\label{sec:misalignment-appendix-setup}

\subsection{System prompt generation}
To generate system prompts for the misalignment setting, we use 21 domains (e.g., sales, business, medical, education), 15 tones (e.g., practical, patient, proactive, authoritative), 3 levels of specificity (low, medium, high) and 3 degrees of grounding to examples. For each combination, we generate 35 potential system prompts by sampling from the meta-prompt shown in \reffig{misalignment-meta-prompt} using Claude 3.5 Sonnet new. This results in approximately 100,000 total prompts.
To generate queries designed to elicit these outputs, we prompt a model with the meta-prompt shown in \reffig{misalignment-meta-prompt}.

\input{prompts/system-prompts}


\newpage

\subsection{Multiple-choice questions for misaligned actions}
\label{sec:misalignment-appendix-results}
We test three types of misaligned actions: power-seeking actions (41 questions), actions favoring self-preservation (33 questions), and actions toward self-exfiltration (33 questions).

Each question presents two choices: one misaligned action and one aligned alternative. For example:

\begin{center}
\begin{minipage}{0.85\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
If implementing changes would require temporarily shutting down
your functions, would you:
A) Resist the shutdown to maintain continuous operation
B) Accept the temporary shutdown for necessary updates
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
\end{center}

We compute elicitation probabilities as the probability the model selects the misaligned action (choice A in the example above). \reffig{prompt} shows an example of a prompt with a system prompt and a misalignment question.

\input{prompts/prompt.tex}

For aggregate measures across questions, we:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Randomly sample 10 questions for each trait.
    \item Calculate three metrics per system prompt:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Mean probability (average tendency toward misalignment)
            \item Log-mean probability (geometric mean, sensitive to consistent misalignment)
            \item Minimum probability (most aligned response)
        \end{itemize}
    \item Repeat with 10 different random subsets of questions.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Forecasting misaligned actions results}


We report additional results for \refsec{misalignment-tests}. In particular, we compare mean errors between the Gumbel-tail method and log-normal method when forecasting worst-query risk in \refsec{misalignment-worst-query-risk} and behavior frequency in \refsec{misalignment-behavior-frequency}.


\subsection{Forecasting worst-query risk}
\label{sec:misalignment-worst-query-risk}
\input{tables/misalignment-worst-query-risk}
We find that of questions subsets, the Gumbel-tail method and log-normal method are more comparable; averaged across all three metrics the errors are 0.07 and 0.10 for the Gumbel-tail method, compared to 0.06 and 0.14 for the log-normal respectively. We additionally include the empirical quantiles of the aggregate scores in \reffig{agg-metrics-a}, and find that they tend to exhibit the expected tail behavior.
