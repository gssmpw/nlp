\section{Related Work}
\textbf{Retrieval Methods.} Rather than directly relying in LLMs for specific queries, open-domain question answering systems has historically been driven by the development of algorithms aligning queries with external database sources ____. Recent advancements in aligning retrieval-based methods with LLMs have demonstrated promise in this domain ____, with retrieval augmented generation ____ showing capabilities in both multimodal ____ and multilingual ____ contexts. However, while the use of external sources avoids the need for fine-tuning, challenges still persist in precisely identifying the relevant context for a given query ____.

\textbf{Truthfulness.} Efforts to enhance the reliability of LLMs without depending on external sources have been a focal point of recent research. Aligning LLMs with human feedback has been explored through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback ____ and Direct Preference Optimization ____, offering valuable insights for veracity alignment ____. Additionally, approaches contrasting hidden representations of these models have also yielded significant results ____ in this direction.

\textbf{Factual Knowledge Editors.}
This research builds upon MEMIT, a method adept at efficiently introducing knowledge by modifying the internal weights of decoder-only architectures, surpassing the effectiveness of earlier meta-learning techniques like MEND ____ and constrained fine-tuning ____. Nevertheless, less intrusive alternatives, which selectively modify specific hidden states of the model during inference according to the provided prompt, have also demonstrated remarkable efficacy in knowledge editing. Notable examples include REMEDI ____, GRACE ____, and SERAC ____. 

\textbf{Multilingual Domain.}
The emergence of knowledge editors and multilingual models raises questions about whether the information is being inserted from a cross-lingual perspective. Current findings suggest that these methods are not entirely language-independent ____, with approaches based on prompting and retrieval yielding stronger results ____. 

% Nevertheless, concurrent works that point to the existence of language-independent knowledge neurons ____ and masking-based approaches ____ hint at potential solutions to the cross-lingual knowledge editing problem.
