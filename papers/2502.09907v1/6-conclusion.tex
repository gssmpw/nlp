\section{Conclusion}

This paper develops a prior-independent framework for designing bidding strategies in first-price auctions, using worst-case regret as the performance metric. Our approach bypasses the need for strong distributional assumptions about competing bids, making it robust to uncertainty in auction environments. We provide an efficient procedure to (i)~evaluate and compare the worst-case regret of arbitrary strategies, and (ii)~construct a minimax-optimal bidding strategy as solution to an ODE. Importantly, our method works for every value distribution; a fact we use to analyze its impact on regret. Our minimax-optimal strategy provides a principled way for buyers to contend with uncertainty about the competition, whether due to a lack of data or rapid changes in the market. Moreover, it consistently attains lower regret than the uniform-bid-shading strategies advocated by prior work.
