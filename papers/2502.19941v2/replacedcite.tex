Early QE approaches predominantly relied on handcrafted features (e.g. alignment-based confidence____, source complexity____) designed to capture linguistic and statistical indicators.
Recently, ____ and ____ regard generation probability of neural models as QE features.

CometKiwi____ aims to transfer QE knowledge by leveraging labeled datasets across diverse annotations and languages.
However, this idea still faces the pitfall of distribution shift, as highlighted in ____, primarily due to the scarcity of QE data.
To address this limitation, synthetic data generation methods have emerged.
(1) Negative sampling-based approaches like DirectQE____ and MQMQE____, utilize translation models to generate synthetic errors through negative sampling, then directly regard error rate as sentence-level scores; (2) BSQE____ and CBSQE____, which generate synthetic translations based on search algorithms and derive labels by matching synthetic translations with references.
In this work, we aim to alleviate the distribution shift problem by leveraging supervision signals and
increasing model diversity.
