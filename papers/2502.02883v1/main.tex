%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Natural language interaction with sensing systems is crucial for enabling all users to comprehend sensor data and its impact on their everyday lives.
However, existing systems, which typically operate in a Question Answering (QA) manner, are significantly limited in terms of the \textit{duration} and \textit{complexity} of sensor data they can handle.

In this work, we introduce \Method, the first end-to-end QA system designed for long-term sensor monitoring with multimodal and high-dimensional data including time series. \Method effectively answers both qualitative (requiring high-level reasoning) and quantitative (requiring accurate responses derived from sensor data) questions in real-world scenarios. To achieve this, \Method uses an innovative three-stage pipeline that includes question decomposition, sensor data query, and answer assembly.
The first and third stages leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) for intuitive human interactions and to guide the sensor data query process.
Unlike existing multimodal LLMs, \Method incorporates an explicit query stage to precisely extract factual information from long-duration sensor data.
We implement \Method and demonstrate its capability for real-time interactions on a cloud server while also being able to run entirely on edge platforms after quantization. Comprehensive QA evaluations show that \Method achieves up to 26\% higher answer accuracy than state-of-the-art systems on quantitative questions. Additionally, a user study with eight volunteers highlights \Method's effectiveness in handling qualitative and open-ended questions.
\end{abstract}
