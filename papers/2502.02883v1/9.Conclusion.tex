\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Natural interactions between users and multimodal sensors can unlock the full potential of sensor data in real-world applications. However, existing systems struggle to process long-duration, high-dimensional sensor data, often resulting in unsatisfactory answers to long-term questions.
In this paper, we present \Method, the first edge system designed to handle long-duration, time-series sensor data for both qualitative and quantitative question answering. \Method introduces a novel three-stage pipeline including question decomposition, sensor data query and answer assembly.
All stages and interfaces are carefully designed to effectively fuse the natural language and the sensor modality.
Evaluation results and user studies demonstrate \Method's effectiveness in answering a wide range of qualitative and quantitative questions. The cloud version of \Method system supports real-time interactions, while the edge version is optimized to run on Jetson-level devices.
%show that \Method enhances the answer accuracy by up to 26\% compared to state-of-the-art QA systems while achieving an average generating latency of 0.63s on the desktop.
%We further validate the practical value and challenges with \Method in a real user study.
