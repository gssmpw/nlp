In this paper, we provide fast and practical 2-approximation greedy algorithms for the problem of advertising in content feeds.
We provide the first comprehensive empirical study on the problem, showing the strong performance of our methods. %
Regarding potential future work,
designing improved online algorithms, 
and studying alternative pricing schemes, dynamic rewards, and more flexible decaying functions 
are all interesting directions.
