\subsubsection{Massive Grant-Free Transmission in Cell-Free Wireless Communication Systems}
Recent results have focused on AUD, channel estimation (CE), and data detection (DD) for massive grant-free transmission in cell-free wireless communication systems \cite{sun2023joint_arxiv,sun2023deep_unfolding, Ganesan2021algorithm, shao2020covariance, wang2021grant, Li2023Asynchronous, Diao2023Scalable, Jiang2023EM,wang2022two,guo2022joint, Ke2021massive, Johnston2022model, Di2022adaptive, Femenias2023repetition, zhou2023active, Iimori2021grant}.

%
Capitalizing on the a-priori distribution of channel coefficients, reference~\cite{Jiang2023EM} introduces a modified expectation-maximization approximate message passing (AMP) algorithm for CE, followed by AUD through the posterior support probabilities.
%
Reference~\cite{wang2022two} proposes a two-stage AUD and CE method, in which AUD is first conducted via adjacent APs utilizing vector AMP, and CE is performed through a linear estimator.
%
Reference~\cite{guo2022joint} performs joint AUD and CE through a single-measurement-vector-based minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation approach at each AP independently.
%
Considering both centralized and edge computing paradigms, reference~\cite{Ke2021massive} presents an AMP-based approach for the joint AUD and CE while addressing quantization accuracy.
%
In millimeter-wave systems, reference~\cite{Johnston2022model} introduces two distinct algorithms for joint AUD and CE, leveraging the inherent characteristic that each UE's channel predominantly comprises a few significant propagation paths.

%
Reference~\cite{zhou2023active} first presents a joint AUD and CE approach for grant-free transmission using orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation in low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication systems. 
Subsequently, it introduces a least squares-based parallel time domain signal detection method.
%
Reference~\cite{Iimori2021grant} presents a Gaussian approximation-based Bayesian message passing algorithm for JACD, combined with an advanced low-coherence pilot design. 
%
Our previous work in~\cite{sun2023deep_unfolding} introduced a DU-based JAD algorithm, in which all algorithm hyper-parameters are optimized using machine learning. 
%
In addition, our study in~\cite{sun2023joint_arxiv} presents a box-constrained FBS algorithm designed for JACD.
%
Unlike previous methods, this paper tackles the task of JACD for massive grant-free transmission in cell-free systems. 
%
To improve JACD performance, we capture the sporadic UE activity more accurately by representing both the channel matrix and the data matrix as sparse matrices.


\subsubsection{Joint Active User Detection, Channel Estimation, and Data Detection for Single-Cell Massive Grant-Free Transmission}

JACD for single-cell massive grant-free transmission has been extensively investigated in~\cite{zou2020alow, Di2022joint, zhang2023joint, jiang2020joint, bai2023deep, Bian2023joint, shen2023joint}.
%
Considering low-precision data converters, reference~\cite{zou2020alow} utilizes bilinear generalized AMP (Bi-GAMP) with belief propagation algorithms for JACD in single-cell mMTC systems.
%
Reference~\cite{Di2022joint} proposes a bilinear message-scheduling generalized AMP for JACD, in which the channel decoder beliefs are used to refine AUD and DD.
%
Reference~\cite{zhang2023joint} develops a Bi-GAMP algorithm for JACD,  capturing the row-sparse channel matrix structure stemming from channel correlations.
%
Reference~\cite{jiang2020joint} divides the JACD scheme into slot-wise AUD and joint signal and channel estimation, which are addressed using message passing.
%
Reference~\cite{bai2023deep} combines AMP and belief propagation (BP) to perform JACD for asynchronous mMTC systems, in which the UEs transmit different lengths of data packets.
%
Reference~\cite{Bian2023joint} introduces a turbo-structured receiver for JACD and data decoding, utilizing the channel decoder's information to improve CE and DD performance.
%
Reference~\cite{shen2023joint} introduces a JACD algorithm based on message passing and Markov random fields for LEO satellite-enabled mMTC scenarios, which employs OTFS modulation to capitalize on the sparsity in the delay-Doppler-angle domain.
%
In contrast to these message-passing-based JACD methods that have been designed for single-cell systems that primarily focus on UE activity sparsity, we consider the JACD problem in cell-free systems by taking into account two distinct sources of sparsity in the channel matrix: (i) column sparsity, which stems from the sporadic UE activity in mMTC scenarios, and (ii) block sparsity within each non-zero column, which stems from the vast discrepancies in large-scale channel fading between UEs and distributed APs in cell-free systems~\cite{song2022joint}. 
%
Furthermore, we propose our JACD methods within the FBS framework, incorporating efficient strategies to improve the JACD performance and reduce computational complexity.


\subsubsection{Deep-Unfolding for  Massive Grant-Free Transmission and Cell-Free Systems}

%
In contrast to these results, we deploy DU to train all hyper-parameters in our proposed algorithms to improve the JACD performance and employ approximations for high-complexity steps to decrease computational complexity.
%
Furthermore, we train the hyper-parameters of our soft-output AUD module that generates information on UE activity probability.
