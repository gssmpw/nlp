In cellular networks, virtualized Radio Access Networks (vRANs) enable replacing traditional specialized hardware at cell sites with software running on commodity servers distributed across edge and remote clouds. However, some vRAN functions (e.g., forward error correction (FEC) decoding) require excessive edge compute resources due to their intensive computational demands and inefficiencies caused by workload fluctuations.
This high demand for computational power significantly drives up the costs associated with edge computing, posing a major challenge for deploying 5G/6G vRAN solutions.

To address this challenge, we propose \Name{}, a hierarchical architecture for vRAN that enables the distribution of uplink FEC decoding processing across edge and remote clouds. \Name{} refactors the vRAN stack and introduces mechanisms that allow controlling and managing the workload over these hierarchical cloud resources.
More specifically, \Name{} splits the traditional non-stop run-to-completion iterative FEC decoding process into latency-critical early decoding iterations, i.e., related to MAC processing and early pre-parsing for content identification, and completion decoding iterations, i.e., decoding tasks with larger decoding delay budgets for final data bits extraction. This partitioning provides \Name{} the flexibility to utilize the available midhaul (MH) network for offloading the latency tolerant part of decoding to remote cloud instances, while performing time-sensitive decoding at the edge cloud locations for low-delay processing.
\Name{} controls decoding load distribution between the edge and remote clouds, based on the edge decoding capacity and the offload network bandwidth, thus improving the utilization of edge compute. %and maxmize system throughput?

Our results show that \Name{} can provide full decoding capacity with significantly less edge decoding resources by leveraging the existing MH bandwidth for offloading.
In addition, \Name{} provides smooth degradation of the required compute resources when the edge decoding capacity is reduced or underprovisioned.
