Please categorize the given text belong to agent-relevant data or other general text. The 
    definitions are as follows:
1. Agent: Tool documentation text that describes the usage of a tool, software, or API; and action 
    trajectory text that describes a sequence of actions or steps to achieve a goal.
2. General: Other general text that does not belong to the above two categories.
Below are some examples:

**API: `easyai.model.base_block.utility.utility_block.ConvBNActivationBlock`**  
The `ConvBNActivationBlock` is a utility class that combines a convolutional layer, a batch 
normalization layer, and an activation layer into a single block. This block is commonly used as a 
building block in various neural network architectures, including the PNASNet architecture 
demonstrated in the provided code.  **Parameters:**  - `in_channels` (int): The number of input 
channels for the convolutional layer. 
- `out_channels` (int): The number of output channels for the convolutional layer. 
- `kernel_size` (int or tuple): The size of the convolutional kernel. 
- `stride` (int or tuple, optional): The stride of the convolutional operation. Default is 1. 
- `padding` (int or tuple, optional): The padding added to the input tensor before applying the 
    convolution. Default is 0.
- `bias` (bool, optional): Whether to include a bias term in the convolutional layer. Default is 
    `False`. 
- `bnName` (str or `easyai.base_name.block_name.NormalizationType`, optional): The normalization 
    type to be used. Default is `NormalizationType.BatchNormalize2d`. 
- `activationName` (str or `easyai.base_name.block_name.ActivationType`, optional): The activation 
    function to be used. Default is `ActivationType.ReLU`.

I want to deliver a Birthday Gift to my friend in London, UK. Then, I need to book a flight from 
New York, USA to London, UK on August 1st, 2023 for myself. After arriving in London, I would like 
to see Dr. Smith for my Migraine. Once my health is in check, I'd like to apply for a Software 
Engineer job in London. 
Step 1: Call deliver_package API with package: 'Birthday Gift' and destination: 'London, UK' 
deliver_package(package=Birthday Gift, destination=London, UK) 
Step 2: Call book_flight API with date: '2023-08-01', from: 'New York, USA' and to: 'London, UK' 
book_flight(date=2023-08-01, from=New York, USA, to=London, UK) 
Step 3: Call see_doctor_online API with disease: 'Migraine' and doctor: 'Dr. Smith' 
see_doctor_online(disease=Migraine, doctor=Dr. Smith) 
Step 4: Call apply_for_job API with job: 'Software Engineer' apply_for_job(job=Software Engineer)"

My New Crock Pot -- Creuzer Leave a comment on My New Crock Pot I went out and got myself a new 
crock pot. I rather like this one. It has 3 settings, High, Low, and Warm. It is designed to 
be hauled around even! There are latches on each side of the lid to clip the lid in place. It 
even came with it's own spoon that clips into the lid! A really neat feature is that the lid has 
little tabs so you can set the lid on one of the handles and it won't go all sliding all over 
the place. I think this is a winner, I plan on using it a lot for the cooking club I am in.
