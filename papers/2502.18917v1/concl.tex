In this paper, we describe an approach to leverage LLMs and a lightweight mixed static/dynamic approach to synthesize class invariants. 
Our experiments on standard C++ data structures as well as a popular and high-assurance codebase demonstrate the feasibility of our approach.
Our technique is currently limited by an automated way to integrate the generated tests into the build system of the underlying repo, and the need for developers to validate the invariants.
We envision that integrating \tech with the continuous integration (CI) and pull requests (PR) can aid in scaling the approach to more developers.
In future work, we also plan to investigate incorporating developer feedback to repair or strengthen generated invariants.
