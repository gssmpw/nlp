In this section, we evaluate the quality of \tech invariants. 
Specifically, we explore the following research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How many of these invariants are \textbf{correct} (with respect to the user-provided test cases) and do they capture essential properties of the source code (Section~\ref{subsec:correctness})?
    \item How \textbf{complete} are the invariants in their ability to distinguish the correct program from buggy counterparts (Section~\ref{subsec:completeness})? 
    \item How does \tech compare to a state-of-the-art technique in invariant generation (namely Daikon, the most widely adopted tool for dynamic invariant synthesis) (Section~\ref{subsec:daikon_compare})?
\end{enumerate}


Our experiments were conducted on a machine with 24 CPU cores and 64 GB of RAM. We implemented \tech using GPT-4o as the underlying LLM, with its default temperature setting of 1.
