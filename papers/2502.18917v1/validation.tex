% \subsection{Validation Phase}
% \livia{move to Eval. proxy to user.}

The validation phase provides external verification using existing unit tests.
The process begins by taking \textit{filtered invariants} from the generation phase and instrumenting source code with candidate invariants.
The verification process employs unit tests for the input program as ground truth, which contain input-output pairs, unlike the generated tests.
The framework executes instrumented code against unit tests to verify invariant validity during test execution.
The validation uses the same instrumentation approach described in Section~\ref{sec:instrumentation}, but with ground truth unit tests providing final verification of candidate invariants.
