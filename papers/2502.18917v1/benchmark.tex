We use a C++ implementation of classical data structures for our micro-benchmarks~\cite{cpp_ds}, which include 9 data structures with associated unit tests: \CodeIn{AvlTree}, \CodeIn{BinarySearchTree}, \CodeIn{HashTable}, \CodeIn{Heap}, \CodeIn{LinkedList}, \CodeIn{Queue}, \CodeIn{RedBlackTree}, \CodeIn{Stack}, and \CodeIn{Vector}.
Table~\ref{tab:benchmark-detail} shows the statistics of these benchmark data structures.
To ensure correctness, we thoroughly examined each benchmark example and corrected a few implementation bugs, treating this refined benchmark as the ground truth. All subsequent experiments are based on this benchmark setup.
\shuvendu{It would be interesting to mention how the bug was found with the generated invariants and tests, with the user in the loop to not remove an invariant that failed the test. Perhaps informally, in the Discussion section.}





In addition to textbook examples, we also conducted experiments on utility classes~\cite{z3util} from \zthree~\cite{z3}, including \CodeIn{ema}, \CodeIn{dlist}, \CodeIn{heap}, \CodeIn{hashtable}, \CodeIn{permutation}, \CodeIn{scoped\_vector}, and the most complex class, \CodeIn{bdd\_manager}. The latter will be discussed in detail as a case study, including an evaluation with one of the authors of \zthree.
