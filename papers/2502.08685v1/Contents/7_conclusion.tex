\section{Conclusion}
We introduce an interpretable and adaptable recommendation framework to enhance data utilization and meet the specific requirements of model architectures and evaluation metrics. Our approach includes a data valuator to assess data quality through the calculation of Shapley value, ensuring robust mathematical properties. 
Additionally, we develop a metric adapter based on reinforcement learning to accommodate various evaluation metrics, including both differentiable and non-differentiable. Our extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving notable improvements in accuracy, diversity, and fairness metrics.
