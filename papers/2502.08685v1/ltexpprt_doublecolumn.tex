% This file is to be used as an example for style only. It should not be read
% for content.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING STYLE RESTRICTIONS %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%  1. There are no new tags.  Existing LaTeX tags have been formatted to match
%%     the Preprint series style.
%%
%%  2. Do not change the margins or page size!  Do not change from the default
%%     text font!
%%
%%  3. You must use \cite in the text to mark your reference citations and
%%     \bibitem in the listing of references at the end of your chapter. See
%%     the examples in the following file. If you are using BibTeX, please
%%     supply the bst file with the manuscript file.
%%
%%  4. This macro is set up for two levels of headings (\section and
%%     \subsection). The macro will automatically number the headings for you.
%%
%%  5. No running heads are to be used for this volume.
%%
%%  6. Theorems, Lemmas, Definitions, Equations, etc. are to be double numbered,
%%     indicating the section and the occurrence of that element
%%     within that section. (For example, the first theorem in the second
%%     section would be numbered 2.1. The macro will
%%     automatically do the numbering for you.
%%
%%  7. Figures and Tables must be single-numbered.
%%     Use existing LaTeX tags for these elements.
%%     Numbering will be done automatically.
%%
%%  8. Page numbering is no longer included in this macro.
%%     Pagination will be set by the program committee.
