\section{Experimental Settings \label{app:implementation}}

We follow the model architecture design and hyperparameter settings of \citet{luo2024classic}. In order to accommodate the computational requirements for our extensive experiments, we harness a variety of high-capacity GPU resources. This includes: Tesla V100 32Gb, NVIDIA RTX A6000
48Gb, NVIDIA RTX A5000 24Gb, and Quadro RTX 8000 48Gb.
