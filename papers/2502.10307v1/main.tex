    % Illustration of our method: A foundational vision encoder (top-left) extracts embeddings from a sky camera image from any location or setup. Physics-inspired features are mathematically derived from auxiliary values and then concatenated with them to form a unified auxiliary vector. The image embedding vector is then merged with this auxiliary vector (top-middle) to construct a comprehensive representation vector. For nowcasting (right), a regressor predicts Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI) from this feature vector. For forecasting (bottom), a time-series model processes a sequence of past feature vectors to create a past context embedding which is concatenated with the future covariate vector, created from future values known in the present, to create the final latent representation which is then mapped to GHI values (bottom-right) corresponding to the future intervals using a regressor.
    Illustration of our system: A vision encoder (top-left) extracts embeddings from a sky camera image sampled from a diverse set spanning multiple locations and setups. Physics-inspired features are derived and integrated with auxiliary values, then merged with the image embedding (top-middle) into a unified representation. For nowcasting (right), a regressor predicts Global Horizontal Irradiance from this feature vector. For forecasting (bottom), a time-series model processes past feature vectors to create a context embedding, which is concatenated with a future covariate vector—constructed from known future values—to form the final latent representation. A regressor then maps this representation to future GHI values (bottom-right).

\section{Conclusion}

This work addresses a critical challenge in solar irradiance forecasting: adapting models to new geographic locations with no prior data. By utilizing transfer learning and pre-trained models, SPIRIT generalizes well to new locations, reducing the reliance on large, location-specific datasets. As more site-specific data becomes available post-deployment, the system can be effectively fine-tuned, improving prediction accuracy and supporting better energy yield estimates and operational planning. Additionally, SPIRIT’s modular design allows for the seamless integration of any emerging vision models, ensuring that the framework remains up-to-date with the latest advancements. This scalable solution for solar irradiance forecasting can accelerate the deployment of solar farms—particularly in remote and emerging markets. SPIRIT supports the transition to renewable energy by enhancing the reliability, cost-effectiveness, and accessibility of solar energy generation.





% Our system offers significant practical benefits for solar panel deployment. In new installations, where historical data is unavailable, our approach generalizes well. As additional site-specific data becomes available, the system can be fine-tuned to further enhance prediction accuracy, thereby improving energy yield estimates and operational planning. This inherent adaptability reduces reliance on extensive datasets, making the technology especially valuable in emerging markets and remote regions. Ultimately, our system facilitates more efficient, reliable, and cost-effective solar energy generation, supporting the broader adoption of renewable energy solutions.

% This work addresses a critical challenge in the domain of solar irradiance forecasting — creating models that can adapt seamlessly to new geographic locations and camera setups, even with little to no prior data. By leveraging foundation models and integrating physics-inspired feature engineering, we developed a comprehensive system that achieves state-of-the-art generalizability, outperforming traditional approaches requiring years of site-specific data. Our contributions offer a scalable and efficient solution that enables faster deployment of solar farms in new locations, facilitating a smoother and more accessible transition to renewable energy.
