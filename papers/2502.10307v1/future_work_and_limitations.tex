One key limitation is that the datasets used for evaluation are all from North America, largely due to the limited availability of publicly accessible datasets from other regions. Specifically, the solar movement patterns and dynamics change in the Southern Hemisphere and need to be studied. To improve the generalizability of our system, future work will incorporate data from other continents. Additionally, while our model performs well, the use of foundation models introduces real-time inference costs and computational overheads. Future efforts will focus on reducing computational efficiency, enabling deployment on resource-constrained edge devices without sacrificing accuracy.
