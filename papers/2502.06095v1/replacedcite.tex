% % Semantic communication originated from Shannon and Weaver's seminal work in 1948 ____, where Weaver laid out the three fundamental levels of communications:
% % (A) the ``technical level'', which tries to answer the question ``how accurately can the symbols of communication be transmitted?''.
% % (B) the ``semantic level'', tries to answer the question ``how precisely do the transmitted symbols convey the desired meaning?''.
% % Finally, level (C), the ``effectiveness level'', asks the question ``how effectively does the received meaning affect conduct in the desired way?''.
% % For the past 70 years, we have mostly considered the technical problem, due to Shannon's separation theorem, which states that for memoryless channels, the separate optimization of source and channel coding is optimal over infinite blocklength ____.
