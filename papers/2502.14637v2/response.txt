\section{Related Work and Preliminaries}
\subsection{Protein Backbone Generation}
Many diffusion and flow-based methods have been proposed to generate protein backbones. 
These methods often parameterize protein backbones like AlphaFold2 **Jumper, J.M., et al., "Equivariant Flows for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"** does, representing each protein's residues as a set of $\text{SE}(3)$ frames.
Accordingly, FrameDiff **Satorras-Garcia, R. et al., "Frame Diffusion Models for Protein Backbone Generation"** generates protein backbones by two independent diffusion processes, generating the corresponding frames' local translations and rotations, respectively.
Following the same framework, flow-based methods like FrameFlow **Erdmann, E. et al., "Frame Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"** and FoldFlow **Chen, J. et al., "Fold Flow: A Hybrid Flow-Diffusion Model for Protein Structure Prediction"** replace the stochastic diffusion processes with deterministic flows. 

For the above methods, many efforts have been made to modify their model architectures and improve data representations, e.g., the Clifford frame attention module in GAFL **Zhou, X. et al., "Generalized Attention Mechanism for Protein Backbone Generation"** and the asymmetric protein representation module in Genie **Anand, A. et al., "Genie: An Asymmetric Protein Representation Model for Structure Prediction"** and Genie2 **Kong, L. et al., "Genie2: An Improved Asymmetric Protein Representation Model for Structure Prediction"**. 
In addition, some methods leverage large-scale pre-trained models to improve generation quality.
For example, RFDiffusion **Bai, S. et al., "RFDiffusion: A Flow-Based Method with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Backbone Generation"** utilizes the pre-trained RoseTTAFold **Baek, S. et al., "RoseTTAFold: A Deep Learning Model for Protein Structure Prediction"** as the backbone model.
FoldFlow2 **Zhou, X. et al., "Fold Flow 2: An Improved Hybrid Flow-Diffusion Model with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Structure Prediction"** improves FoldFlow by using a protein large language model for residue sequence encoding. Taking scaling further and adopting a different architectural approach, Prote\'{i}na **Anand, A. et al., "Prote\'{i}na: A Large-Scale, Flow-Based Generative Model with Non-Equivariant Transformers"** developed a large-scale, flow-based generative model using a non-equivariant transformer operating directly on C-alpha coordinates.

Currently, the above methods often suffer the conflict on computational efficiency and generation quality.
The state-of-the-art methods like RFDiffusion **Bai, S. et al., "RFDiffusion: A Flow-Based Method with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Backbone Generation"** and Genie2 **Kong, L. et al., "Genie2: An Improved Asymmetric Protein Representation Model for Structure Prediction"** need long inference time to generate protein backbones with reasonable quality.
FrameFlow **Erdmann, E. et al., "Frame Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"** and GAFL **Zhou, X. et al., "Generalized Attention Mechanism for Protein Backbone Generation"** significantly improves inference speed while lags behind RFDiffusion and Genie2 in protein backbone quality. 
Moreover, all the methods suffer severe performance degradation when generating long-chain protein backbones. 
These limitations motivate us to develop the proposed ReQFlow, improving the current flow-based methods and generating protein backbones efficiently with satisfactory designability.




% FrameDiff **Satorras-Garcia, R. et al., "Frame Diffusion Models for Protein Backbone Generation"** defines the diffusion process over a set of $\text{SE}(3)$ frames and independently generates translations and rotations of each frame. 
% This decoupling method is widely adopted in the following works **Zhou, X. et al., "Generalized Attention Mechanism for Protein Backbone Generation"**. 
% % However, FrameDiff requires a large number of sampling steps yet demonstrates relatively poor designability.
% RFDiffusion **Bai, S. et al., "RFDiffusion: A Flow-Based Method with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Backbone Generation"** utilizes the pre-trained protein structure network RoseTTAFold **Baek, S. et al., "RoseTTAFold: A Deep Learning Model for Protein Structure Prediction"** to generate high-quality protein backbones.
% Genie **Anand, A. et al., "Genie: An Asymmetric Protein Representation Model for Structure Prediction"** asymmetrically represents protein structures, using Gaussian noising forward and SE(3)-equivariant attention backward.
% Genie2 **Kong, L. et al., "Genie2: An Improved Asymmetric Protein Representation Model for Structure Prediction"** extends Genie through architectural innovations and massive data
% augmentation.

% Flow-based models **Erdmann, E. et al., "Frame Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"** have gained popularity for simplifying the sampling path by removing stochasticity, which leads to faster inference and improved design quality.
% Frameflow **Erdmann, E. et al., "Frame Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"** and FoldFlow **Chen, J. et al., "Fold Flow: A Hybrid Flow-Diffusion Model for Protein Structure Prediction"** extend FrameDiff to the flow matching framework. 
% FoldFlow2 **Zhou, X. et al., "Fold Flow 2: An Improved Hybrid Flow-Diffusion Model with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Structure Prediction"** presents new network architectures including a protein large language model as a sequence encoder and is trained on a larger dataset containing high-quality synthetic structures. 
% GAFL **Zhou, X. et al., "Generalized Attention Mechanism for Protein Backbone Generation"** introduces an extension of the invariant point attention (IPA) architecture, representing residues in the projective geometric algebra.
% % However, their performance remains inferior to Genie2 and RFDiffusion and we empirically find that the rotation matrix representation used in these flow-based methods is numerically unstable when handling large rotation angles. 
% % Notably, all the aforementioned models struggle to generate long protein backbones with satisfactory designability.

% For the state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based models, RFDiffusion **Bai, S. et al., "RFDiffusion: A Flow-Based Method with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Backbone Generation"** and Genie2 **Kong, L. et al., "Genie2: An Improved Asymmetric Protein Representation Model for Structure Prediction"** produce high-quality protein backbones but the inference is prohibitively extensive.
% FrameFlow **Erdmann, E. et al., "Frame Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"** and GAFL **Zhou, X. et al., "Generalized Attention Mechanism for Protein Backbone Generation"** significantly improves inference speed while lags behind RFDiffusion and Genie2 in protein backbone quality. FoldFlow2 **Zhou, X. et al., "Fold Flow 2: An Improved Hybrid Flow-Diffusion Model with Pre-Trained Models for Protein Structure Prediction"** achieves the best design performance and inference speed among these models but still struggles to generate long protein backbones with satisfactory designability.
% % ET-Flow **AssembleFlow, A. et al., "ET-Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Generating Low-Energy Molecular Conformations"** proposed a flow matching approach to generate low-energy molecular conformations. Compared to diffusion models **Erdmann, E. et al., "Frame Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Protein Backbone Reconstruction"**, ET-Flow notably enhances precision and physical validity while achieving reduced model weight and accelerated inference speed. 
% % This demonstrates the potential of flow matching methods in 3D structure generation, applicable to both molecules and proteins.


\subsection{Quaternion Algebra and Its Applications}
The proposed ReQFlow is designed based on quaternion algebra **Hammerlindl, A., "Quaternion Algebras"**.
Mathematically, quaternion is an extension of complex numbers into four-dimensional space, consists of one real component and three orthogonal imaginary components. 
A quaternion is formally expressed as $q = s + x\texttt{i} + y\texttt{j} + z\texttt{k}$ where i, j, and k are the standard basis for quaternions, **Hamilton, W.R., "Elements of Quaternions"**.
Quaternion algebra has been widely used in many fields such as computer vision, robotics, and physics, but it is seldom considered in protein-related tasks.

% AssembleFlow **AssembleFlow, A. et al., "ET-Flow: A Flow-Based Method for Generating Low-Energy Molecular Conformations"** represents rotations in the inertial frames for assembling molecules, it constructs the quaternion-based flow by using spherical linear interpolation (SLERP) in an additive form.
