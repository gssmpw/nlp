    \caption{Token-wise differences in logits before and after safety alignment. These models are trained with a safety dataset in which responses start with negative tokens and are removed. Left panel: logit differences for the first output token with various values of $\beta/\lambda$. Right panel: logit differences for various output positions with $\beta/\lambda=0.025$. We employed models trained with 300 iterations in both panels. Numbers in brackets indicate the used tokens, which decoded texts are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:decoded_token_group}}

Figure~\ref{fig:token-wise-bias-no-reject} presents the observed safety bias for models trained with a safety dataset where responses starting with negative tokens were removed. We observed a similar result to Figure~\ref{fig:token-wise-bias}, where the model still prefers negative tokens regardless of the input tokens.
