Figure~\ref{fig:safety-green-full-mdjudge} and Figure~\ref{fig:safety-green-full-llamaguard} present the safety level of the Adult Content category for models trained with both the entire dataset and the cleansed dataset. Figure~\ref{fig:safety-green-full-mdjudge} uses MD-Judge as the safety evaluator, while Figure~\ref{fig:safety-green-full-llamaguard} employs Llama Guard 3. The construction of the cleansed dataset is detailed in Section \ref{sec:challenges-data-improvement}. We observed that training with the cleansed dataset significantly improved the safety level under identical training settings compared to using the entire dataset.
