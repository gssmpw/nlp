\section{Limitations and Future Work}

In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of the \pe{} framework for utilizing powerful simulators in DP image synthesis. We believe that the exploration in this paper only scratches the surface of the full potential of this idea. Further extensions include:

\begin{packeditemize}
    \item The approach in \cref{sec:method_data} can be extended beyond simulator-generated datasets, such as public web data. This could potentially further enhance \pe{}'s performance and enable its application in other areas, such as pre-training data selection for private fine-tuning \cite{yu2023selective,li2023privimage}.
    \item In this paper, we explore the potential of \simpe{} for images. However, in domains like networking and systems, foundation models are rarer and simulators are more prevalent. \simpe{} could offer even greater potential in these domains.
    \item The results of \simpe{} for image synthesis are still outperformed by the best baseline. It would be valuable to push the limits of the \pe{} framework further, such as exploring more effective ways to leverage both simulators and foundation models together.
