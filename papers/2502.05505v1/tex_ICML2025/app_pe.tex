\label{app:pe}

\cref{alg:main_full} presents the \privateevolution{} (\pe{}) algorithm, reproduced from \citet{lin2023differentially}.  
This algorithm represents the conditional version of \pe{}, where each generated image is associated with a class label.  
It can be interpreted as running the unconditional version of \pe{} separately for each class.
