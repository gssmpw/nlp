\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
We introduce Open-MeDe, a novel meta-learning framework for open-vocabulary action recognition. 
It adopts a cross-batch meta-optimization, which encourages the video learner to attain generalizable knowledge counteracting inherent known and static biases for effective known-to-open generalizing and image-to-video debiasing.
It also incorporates Gaussian Weight Average to achieve generic optima for robust generalization.
Extensive evaluations in both in-context and out-of-context open-vocabulary scenarios validate the applicability and superiority of our framework.
