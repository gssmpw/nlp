    \caption{Performance comparison (Top-1 Acc (\%)) under various open-vocabulary evaluation settings where the video learners except for CLIP are tuned on Kinetics-400~\cite{k400} with frozen text encoders. The satisfying in-context generalizability on UCF101~\cite{UCF101} (a) can be severely affected by static bias when evaluating on out-of-context SCUBA-UCF101~\cite{li2023mitigating} (b) by replacing the video background with other images.}
