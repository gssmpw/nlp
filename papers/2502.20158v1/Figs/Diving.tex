    \caption{Visualizations of attention maps and predictions for ``\textit{Diving}'' in the out-of-context setting. Both methods struggle to classify the action correctly, suggesting more room for improvement under this challenging scenario. Despite the incorrect prediction, our method reflects a better focus on motion-relevant areas, which indicates its effectiveness of mitigating static bias. }
