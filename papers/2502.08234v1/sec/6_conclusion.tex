\section{Conclusion and Limitation}


We have introduced a novel task learning human skill generation at the key-step level. For this task, we construct a benchmark and propose a data curation pipeline along with a diverse set of evaluation metrics. We also propose a new framework for key-step skill generation and evaluate various baseline methods. Additionally, the key-step image generator we proposed effectively addresses the challenge of generating non-continuous key-step videos.  However, our framework remains a multi-stage process, limited by current video generation capabilities, and we aim to propose an end-to-end skill generator. We hope that skill generation will not only help humans acquire more skills but also provide more generation data for embodied intelligence, thereby bridging the gap from reality to simulation. Generative models are no longer limited to producing simple actions. The ultimate goal is to generate processes of higher dimensions, as exemplified by our skill generation. We believe KS-Gen will open a promising and meaningful direction for world generation.
