Cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) is a crucial technique for unveiling the structure of protein complexes.  
Automatically analyzing tomograms captured by cryoET is an essential step toward understanding cellular structures.  
In this paper, we introduce the 4th place solution from the CZII - CryoET Object Identification competition, which was organized to advance the development of automated tomogram analysis techniques.
Our solution adopted a heatmap-based keypoint detection approach, utilizing an ensemble of two different types of 2.5D U-Net models with depth reduction.
Despite its highly unified and simple architecture, our method achieved 4th place, demonstrating its effectiveness.
