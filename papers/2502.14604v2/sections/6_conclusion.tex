In this paper, we introduce the Zero-Shot Noisy TTA (ZS-NTTA) setting and construct benchmarks for evaluating this task. 
We investigate why existing TTA methods fail in this setting by designing three model adaptation pipelines, visualizing the score difference, and analyzing the gradients to understand the impact of noisy samples on model adaptation.
Based on these analyses, we propose AdaND, which decouples the classifier and detector, focusing on developing an adaptive detector while keeping the classifier frozen.
Our AdaND can handle both noisy and clean data streams by intentionally injecting Gaussian noise, preventing the noise detector from misclassifying excessive ID samples as noise during adaptation.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results in both ZS-NTTA and ZS-OOD detection tasks. Moreover, our approach is computationally efficient.
