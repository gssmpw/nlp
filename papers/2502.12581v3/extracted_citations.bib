abstract = {Today, algorithms such as the gradient boosting machine and the random forest are among the most competitive tools in prediction contests. We review how these algorithms came about. The basic underlying idea is to aggregate predictions from a diverse collection of models. We also explore a few very diverse directions in which the basic idea has evolved, and clarify some common misconceptions that grew as the idea steadily gained its popularity.

  abstract = 	 {Most existing works on crowdsourcing assume that the workers follow the Dawid-Skene model, or the one-coin model as its special case, where every worker makes mistakes independently of other workers and with the same error probability for every task. We study a significant extension of this restricted model. We allow almost half of the workers to deviate from the one-coin model and for those workers, their probabilities of making an error to be task-dependent and to be arbitrarily correlated. In other words, we allow for arbitrary adversaries, for which not only error probabilities can be high, but which can also perfectly collude. In this adversarial scenario, we design an efficient algorithm to consistently estimate the workers’ error probabilities.}
