\begin{abstract}
Navigation Among Movable Obstacles (NAMO) poses a challenge for traditional path-planning methods when obstacles block the path, requiring push actions to reach the goal. 
We propose a framework that enables movability-aware planning to overcome this challenge without relying on explicit obstacle placement.
Our framework integrates a global Semantic Visibility Graph and a local Model Predictive Path Integral (SVG-MPPI) approach to efficiently sample rollouts, taking into account the continuous range of obstacle movability. A physics engine is adopted to simulate the interaction result of the rollouts with the environment, and generate trajectories that minimize contact force.
In qualitative and quantitative experiments, SVG-MPPI outperforms the existing paradigm that uses only binary movability for planning, achieving higher success rates with reduced cumulative contact forces.
Our code is available at: \href{https://github.com/tud-amr/SVG-MPPI}{https://github.com/tud-amr/SVG-MPPI}
