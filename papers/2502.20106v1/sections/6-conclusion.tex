Integrating obstacle movability into robot navigation enables access to previously unreachable areas through obstacle manipulation. We introduce SVG-MPPI, a framework for navigating environments with movable obstacles that minimizes push actions and avoids explicit obstacle placement. SVG informs MPPI by strategically placing nodes around movable obstacles using a continuous movability cost. Instead of relying on explicit contact and dynamics models, SVG-MPPI leverages the Isaac-Gym physics engine for real-time state transitions and contact force data to reduce push actions. Our proposed method outperforms other algorithms, including NVG-MPPI with no movability information, BVG-MPPI and B-RRT-MPPI with a binary notion of movability, in terms of success rate and contact force minimization. Future work could incorporate friction into the movability factor and introduce gain scheduling for more adaptive behavior in extreme movability cases.
