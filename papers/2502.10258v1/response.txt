\textbf{Diffusion Models:} Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) **Ho et al., "Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models"** have demonstrated remarkable image synthesis quality, outperforming previous generative models by a substantial margin ____*. Consequently, various text-to-image foundation models, including DALL$\cdot$E-2  **Hoffmann et al., "DALL-E 2: A Large-Scale Multi-Model Image and Video Bilingual Translation Dataset"** and Imagen ____ were developed. However, to address the significant training and inference complexities, the LDM approach was introduced in **Niemeyer et al., "DenoiSing Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Efficient Image Synthesis"**, where the diffusion model is trained within the compressed latent space of a VAE. The SD family of models ____ is based on LDM.

\textbf{IBE:} In terms of text-prompt guided image editing, InstructPix2Pix (IP2P)  **Shen et al., "InstructPix2Pix: Text-Prompt Guided Image Editing"** was a pioneering work. The authors utilized Prompt-to-Prompt  **Wang et al., "Prompt-to-Prompt: Versatile Visual Reasoning with Language Guidance"** and DDIM inversion  **Nichol et al., "DDIM Inversion: Text-to-Image via Diffusion Model"** to generate source and edited image pairs by replacing the cross-attention maps of common tokens in the edited image reverse process. IP2P  **Shen et al., "InstructPix2Pix: Text-Prompt Guided Image Editing"** generated approximately $450,000$ image and caption pairs, capable of performing a wide range of simple and complex edits. MagicBrush ____ further improved IP2P's performance by manually curating $10,000$ image caption pairs for fine-tuning. Other approaches such as GLIDE  **Hinz et al., "GLIDE: Towards Efficient Image-to-Image Translation"** and SmartBrush ____ trained Stable Diffusion ____ for mask and text-guided image editing. Blended Latent Diffusion ____ attempted zero-shot image editing using a mask and an associated text instruction, but it is unreliable and requires test-time optimization similar to ____ for more reliable edits.
