\textbf{Diffusion Models:} Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) ____ have demonstrated remarkable image synthesis quality, outperforming previous generative models by a substantial margin ____. Consequently, various text-to-image foundation models, including DALL$\cdot$E-2 ____ and Imagen ____, were developed. However, to address the significant training and inference complexities, the LDM approach was introduced in ____, where the diffusion model is trained within the compressed latent space of a VAE. The SD family of models ____ is based on LDM.

\textbf{IBE:} In terms of text-prompt guided image editing, InstructPix2Pix (IP2P) ____ was a pioneering work. The authors utilized Prompt-to-Prompt ____ and DDIM inversion ____ to generate source and edited image pairs by replacing the cross-attention maps of common tokens in the edited image reverse process. IP2P ____ generated approximately $450,000$ image and caption pairs, capable of performing a wide range of simple and complex edits. MagicBrush ____ further improved IP2P's performance by manually curating $10,000$ image caption pairs for fine-tuning. Other approaches such as GLIDE ____ and SmartBrush ____ trained Stable Diffusion ____ for mask and text-guided image editing. Blended Latent Diffusion ____ attempted zero-shot image editing using a mask and an associated text instruction, but it is unreliable and requires test-time optimization similar to ____ for more reliable edits.
