abstract = {In many real world applications, active selection of training examples can significantly reduce the number of labelled training examples to learn a classification function. Different strategies in the field of support vector machines have been proposed that iteratively select a single new example from a set of unlabelled examples, query the corresponding class label and then perform retraining of the current classifier. However, to reduce computational time for training, it might be necessary to select batches of new training examples instead of single examples. Strategies for single examples can be extended straightforwardly to select batches by choosing the h > 1 examples that get the highest values for the individual selection criterion. We present a new approach that is especially designed to construct batches and incorporates a diversity measure. It has low computational requirements making it feasible for large scale problems with several thousands of examples. Experimental results indicate that this approach provides a faster method to attain a level of generalization accuracy in terms of the number of labelled examples.},

abstract = {We propose an algorithm called query by commitee, in which a committee of students is trained on the same data set. The next query is chosen according to the principle of maximal disagreement. The algorithm is studied for two toy models: the high-low game and perceptron learning of another perceptron. As the number of queries goes to infinity, the committee algorithm yields asymptotically finite information gain. This leads to generalization error that decreases exponentially with the number of examples. This in marked contrast to learning from randomly chosen inputs, for which the information gain approaches zero and the generalization error decreases with a relatively slow inverse power law. We suggest that asymptotically finite information gain may be an important characteristic of good query algorithms.},
