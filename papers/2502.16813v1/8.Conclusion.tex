\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conlusion}
This paper proposes \textsf{Snoopy}, an effective and efficient semantic join discovery framework powered by proxy columns.
We devise an approximate-graph-matching-based column projection function to capture column-to-proxy-column relationships, ensuring size-unlimited and permutation-invariant column representations.
To acquire good proxy columns, we present a rank-aware contrastive learning paradigm to learn proxy column matrices for embedding pre-computing and online query encoding.
Extensive experiments on four real-world table repositories demonstrate the superiority of \textsf{Snoopy} in both effectiveness and efficiency. In the future, we plan to consider the downstream data analysis and study the task-oriented join discovery.
