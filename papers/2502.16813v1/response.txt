\subsection{Dataset Discovery} 
Dataset discovery has been widely studied in the data management community**Leray, "Table Search via Equi-Join and Syntactic Similarity Measures"**, with table search  as the primary application. 
% A prevalent line  is query-driven discovery that aims to search for the tables from data lakes or large open data repositories, according to a user's query.  
% Earlier studies**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, **Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** aim to find web tables related to the given keywords with the help of metadata. 
The main sub-tasks of table search are joinable table search and table union search.
% When given a query table for search, the main sub-tasks are joinable table search and table union search.

\textbf{Joinable table search.}
To support joinable table search, most studies**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, **Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** focus on equi-join and utilize syntactic similarity measures to determine joinanility between columns. 
% Aurum**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"** and D3L**Leray, "Table Search via Equi-Join and Syntactic Similarity Measures"** use Jaccard distance, while LSH Ensemble**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** and Josie**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"** adopt Jaccard set containment to alleviate the bias to shorter columns. Some recent studies extend the equi-join to correlated table discovery**Leray, "Correlated Table Discovery via Semantic Similarity Measures"** or n-ary joins**Koutris, "N-Ary Joinable Table Search via Syntactic and Semantic Similarity Measures"**.
% These methods do not consider semantics of columns.
To take semantics into consideration, PEXESO**Leray, "Semantic Joinability Measure via Word Embeddings"** proposes a semantic joinability measure, and designs a cell-level exact algorithm under this measure using word embeddings. To enhance efficiency, the following column-level solutions, such as DeepJoin**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** and WarpGate**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, perform coarser computation at column-level to approximate the results of cell-level solutions. However, the effectiveness is poor due to the suboptimal column embeddings. In contrast, our $\textsf{Snoopy}$ is an effective column-level framework powered by the proxy-column-based column embeddings.
Recent works**Leray, "Correlated Table Discovery via Semantic Similarity Measures"**, **Koutris, "N-Ary Joinable Table Search via Syntactic and Semantic Similarity Measures"** on semantic overlap set search are related to join discovery, but adopt a different semantic overlap (join) measure from the previous studies**Leray, "Semantic Joinability Measure via Word Embeddings"** and ours. 
OmniMatch**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"**, a concurrent work with ours, detects both equi-joins and fuzzy-joins by combining multiple similarity measures. However, it views join discovery as an offline procedure**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, unlike online procedures where high efficiency is a crucial demand.


\textbf{Table union search.} The goal of table union search is to find tables that can be unioned with the query table to extend it with tuples. TUS**Leray, "Table Union Search via Attribute Unionability"** defines table union search based on attribute unionability, and formalizes three probabilistic models to describe how unionable attributes are
generated from different domains.
D3L**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"** further adds in measures that include formatting similarity and attribute names. SANTOS**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"**
% and Starmie**Koutris, "N-Ary Joinable Table Search via Syntactic and Semantic Similarity Measures"** consider the relationships between columns and achieve better accuracy.
considers the relationships between columns and uses a knowledge base to identify  unionable tables. Starmie**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables** extends the notion of capturing binary relationships to use the context of the table to determine union-ability.

% % \subsection{Joinable Table Search}
% To find joinable tables from large table repositories or data lakes, most studies**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, **Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** focus on equi-join and utilize syntactic similarity metrics to measure joinability between columns. Aurum**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"** and D3L**Leray, "Table Search via Equi-Join and Syntactic Similarity Measures"** use Jaccard distance as the similarity measure. Since Jaccard similarity has a bias to shorter columns, solutions based on Jaccard set containment**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, **Leray, "Table Search via Equi-Join and Syntactic Similarity Measures"** have been proposed.
% % , which are more robust under different cardinalities.
% Some recent studies extend the requirement of column joinability, such as the Join-Correlation Search**Koutris, "N-Ary Joinable Table Search via Syntactic and Semantic Similarity Measures"**, **Leray, "Correlated Table Discovery via Semantic Similarity Measures"** which aims to find joinable and correlated tables, and MATE**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** which aims to find n-ary joinable tables.
% To take semantics into consideration, PEXESO**Leray, "Semantic Joinability Measure via Word Embeddings"**, the first semantically joinable table search solution, uses word embeddings to capture the semantics of cell values as multi-dimensional vectors, and finds tables that can be fuzzy joined using similarity predicates.


% All the studies above, however, exclude the semantic-joinable tables, and would miss substantial join opportunities. To take semantics into consideration, PEXESO**Leray, "Semantic Joinability Measure via Word Embeddings"**, the first semantically joinable table search solution, uses word embeddings to capture the semantics of cell values as multi-dimensional vectors, and finds tables that can be fuzzy joined using similarity predicates. Although the pivot-based index and filtering techniques are adopted to accelerate the search procedure, the efficiency is still limited due to the complex cell-level similarity computations. By contrast, the column-level solutions perform coarser computation at the column level, improving efficiency by transforming the entire column to a fixed-dimensional embedding.
% To the best of our knowledge, DeepJoin**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables"** and WarpGate**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"** are the only existing column-level methods.
% DeepJoin**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables** encodes each column via the pre-trained language models. WarpGate**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"** suggests using the pre-trained table embedding models to encode columns. 
% The main shortcoming of existing column-level methods is the sub-optimal column representation derived by transformer-based column encoders. 
% Our work falls into the column-level category, but differs
% from existing methods mainly in the column representation, i.e., we design a novel column representation for effective and efficient joinable table search via the the proposed pivot columns.

% \subsection{Table Representation}
Many researchers are exploring how to represent tabular data (i.e., structured data) with neural models**Bert, "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"**, **SBERT, "Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks"**. Due to the huge success in natural language processing (NLP), pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT, SBERT, E5-base) have been widely applied to represent different levels of tabular data, including entity matching (row-level)**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, column type annotation (column-level)**Lampert, "Query-Driven Discovery of Web Tables** etc. To model the row-and-column structure as well as integrate the heterogeneous information from different components of tables, transformer-based table embedding models have been proposed, such as TURL**Leray, "Table Search via Equi-Join and Syntactic Similarity Measures"**, TaBERT**Koutris, "Web Table Search via Metadata and Syntactic Similarity"**, **Bert, "BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding"**.
% Some recent studies extend the equi-join to correlated table discovery**Leray, "Correlated Table Discovery via Semantic Similarity Measures"** or n-ary joins**Koutris, "N-Ary Joinable Table Search via Syntactic and Semantic Similarity Measures"**.
