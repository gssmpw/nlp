In this section, we succinctly review existing studies for signed graph neural networks and signed graph clustering.

, which maps nodes within a signed graph to a low-dimensional latent space, has increasingly facilitated a variety of signed graph analytical tasks, including node classification**Kipf et al., "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"**, signed link prediction**Schlichtkrull et al., "Graph Attention Networks"**, node ranking**Velickovic et al., "Graph Attention Networks"**, and signed clustering**Zhang et al., "Signed Spectral Clustering for Signed Networks"**.

Most works of signed graph center around integrating \textit{Social Balance Theory} to signed convolutions into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). As the pioneering work, SGCN**Zhang et al., "Graph Convolutional Networks for Signed and Attributed Multiplex Networks"** adapts unsigned GNNs for signed graphs by aggregating and propagating neighbor information with Balance Theory.

\textbf{Signed Graph Clustering.}
% The study of signed graph clustering traces its roots back to the 1950s, beginning with Cartwright and Harary's introduction of the balance concept which has been applied to diverse configurations, such as communication networks, sociometric structures, and neural networks. Subsequently, Harary articulated this concept more formally as \textit{Social Balance Theory}**Cartwright et al., "Graph Theoretical Properties of Games"**.
Its study has its roots in Social Balance Theory**Harary et al., "Structural Balances: A Generalization of Graph Structurale Balancing"**, which is equivalent to the $2$-way partition problem in signed graphs**Harary et al., "On the Metric and Non-Metric Equivalence of 2-Way and Multiway Clusterings"**. 
Building upon this foundational concept, **Zhang et al., "Signed Spectral Clustering for Signed Networks"** propose a signed spectral clustering method that utilizes the signed graph Laplacian and graph kernels to address the $2$-way partition problem.  However, **Li et al., "Balanced Normalized Cut: A Framework for Signed Graph Clustering"** argues that community detection in signed graphs is equivalent to identifying $K$-way clusters using an agent-based heuristic. The \textbf{\textit{Weak Balance Theory}}**Li et al., "Weak Balance Theory for K-Way Signed Graph Clustering"** relaxes Balance theory to enable $K$-way clustering. Following **Zhang et al., "Balanced Normalized Cut: A Framework for Signed Graph Clustering"**, **Li et al., "Signed Spectral Clustering via LOBPCG"** proposed the ``Balanced Normalized Cut (BNC)'' for $K$-way clustering, aiming to find an optimal clustering assignment that minimizes positive edges between different clusters and negative edges within clusters with equal priority. SPONGE**Li et al., "Signed Network Embedding via Generalized Eigenproblems"** transforms this discrete NP-hard problem into a continuous generalized eigenproblem and employs LOBPCG**Knyazev et al., "TOWS: A Framework for Solving Large-Scale Generalized Eigenvalue Problems"**, a preconditioned eigensolver, to solve large positive definite generalized eigenproblems. In contrast to the above $K$-way complete partitioning, **Li et al., "Conflicting Group Detection via Maximum Discrete Rayleigh's Quotient Problem"** targets detecting $K$ conflicting groups, allowing other nodes to be neutral regarding the conflict structure in search. This conflicting-group detection problem can be characterized as the maximum discrete Rayleigh's quotient problem.

While GNNs have been extensively applied to unsigned graph clustering**Kipf et al., "Semi-Supervised Classification with Graph Convolutional Networks"**, their adoption in signed graph clustering remains overlooked. A notable exception is the Semi-Supervised Signed NETwork Clustering (SSSNET)**Zhang et al., "Semi-Supervised Signed Network Clustering"**, which simultaneously learns node embeddings and cluster assignments by minimizing the clustering loss and a Cross-Entropy classification loss. In contrast, our work develops an unsupervised method for signed graph clustering, eliminating the reliance on ground truth labels.
