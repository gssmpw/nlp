\section*{Ethical Considerations}
We discuss the ethical considerations here:
(1) Intellectual property. 
We have strictly adhered to the licenses of all utilized artifacts, including datasets, models, and code repositories. We will open-source \ourmethod, code, and IFBench under the MIT license\footnote{\url{https://opensource.org/license/mit}}.
(2) Intended use and potential risk control.
We propose \textit{agentic reward modeling}, a reward system that integrates human preferences with correctness signals. We implement a reward agent named \ourmethod to provide more reliable rewards. We believe that all data used is well anonymized. Our model does not introduce additional ethical concerns but may provide incorrect rewards due to performance limitations. Users should not conduct reward hacking~\citep{skalse2022defining} and should carefully check important information.
(3) AI assistance. 
We have used ChatGPT to refine some sentences.
