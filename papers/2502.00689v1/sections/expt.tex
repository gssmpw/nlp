\textbf{Representative Conversation Analysis:}
To illustrate the effectiveness of our three-pass dialogue structure in service identification, let's analyze a representative conversation from our user study that demonstrates the system's ability to handle complex, multi-faceted queries:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{User:} What are various landmarks or interesting places that I can visit in the city? Also, I am currently located at IIIT Hyderabad, Gachibowli. I also want to know, how do I get there? Like what all convenient ways of travel can I take, such that my travel is hassel-free? Also let me, know, any convenient nearby places where I can stay, or where my relatives can stay when they are visiting.

\textbf{System:} Hello there! I'm your friendly Hyderabad City Guide, here to help you explore the vibrant city of Hyderabad. It's a wonderful place with a rich history and plenty of interesting landmarks. To get started, could you tell me a bit about your interests? Are you more inclined towards historical sites, nature, shopping, or perhaps food? Also, how much time do you have to explore today?

\textbf{User:} We are inclinded towards historical sites or monuments, however we like food and nature too. When me and my relatives go around to visit places, we often want food stops and all. It is not just today, we have the entire week to travel and explore. Also, since I will be travelling with my family, I would prefer private vehicles. However, I would want to accomodate my family in some nice hotel or some place in the city. And I would want to first reach there, and then we can carry on our trip from there.

\textbf{System:} That sounds like a fantastic plan! Exploring historical sites while enjoying local cuisine and the beauty of nature will surely make for a memorable trip. Let me suggest some must-visit historical landmarks in Hyderabad that you can explore throughout the week...
[System provides detailed recommendations for historical sites, nature spots, food stops, travel options, and accommodation suggestions]

\textbf{User:} I think a few of these places of stay may be in localities that are too expensive. Could we have a more budget-friendly accomodation? Also, I will be having a lot of relatives over. So booking a lot of cabs for them may not be ideal. Could you perhaps suggest some private bus service for us?

\textbf{System:} Based on our conversation, I've identified these services and parameters:

�� travel\_options:
   • preferred\_mode: private\_transport
   • destination: [multiple locations]
�� historical\_info:
   • site\_name: [Charminar, Golconda Fort, Mecca Masjid, Chowmahalla Palace, Qutb Shahi Tombs]
�� restaurant\_finder:
   • group\_size: 4

Does this accurately reflect what you're looking for?

\textbf{User:} Yes

This conversation demonstrates the three-pass dialogue structure:

1. \textbf{First Pass - Context Gathering:}
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Identified user's location (IIIT Hyderabad, Gachibowli)
      \item Probed for interests in historical sites, nature, shopping, or food
      \item Inquired about time availability and travel preferences
   \end{itemize}

2. \textbf{Second Pass - Goal Refinement:}
   The user specified:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item Interest in historical sites and monuments
      \item Secondary interests in food and nature
      \item Week-long exploration timeframe
      \item Preference for private vehicle transport
      \item Need for family accommodation
   \end{itemize}

3. \textbf{Third Pass - Service Identification:}
   The system identified and parameterized three key services:
   \begin{itemize}
      \item \texttt{travel\_options}: 
         \begin{itemize}
            \item preferred\_mode: private\_transport
         \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{historical\_info}:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item site\_name: [Charminar, Golconda Fort, Mecca Masjid, Chowmahalla Palace, Qutb Shahi Tombs]
         \end{itemize}
      \item \texttt{restaurant\_finder}:
         \begin{itemize}
            \item group\_size: 4
         \end{itemize}
   \end{itemize}

This conversation demonstrates the system's ability to handle complex, multi-faceted queries and progressively refine them into concrete service parameters. The user confirmed the accuracy of these identified services and parameters, validating the effectiveness of our approach in understanding and decomposing user requirements.
