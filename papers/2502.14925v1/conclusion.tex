\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:dis}
This paper presents \ourtool, a framework designed to compress retrieved code examples before incorporating them into prompts. The proposed compressor leverage copy-enhanced LMs and are trained on dedicated datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that \ourtool significantly improves the efficiency of retrieval-augmented LMs while maintaining minimal performance degradation. Note that our framework is not limited to RAG, it could be applied to any prompt that contains code examples.
