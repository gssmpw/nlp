\textbf{\ourtool consistently outperforms baselines across studied base LMs CodeLlama-13B and Gemini-1.0.} Figure \ref{fig:llm} compares the performance among the studied prompt compression techniques across two additional base LMs and all three tasks. In comparison, baseline methods exhibit varying effectiveness, occasionally suffering significant performance drops (e.g., RECOMP on CodeLlama for Bug2fix). The consistent superiority underscores \ourtoolâ€™s robustness and effectiveness as a transferable, generalized compression method for code-related tasks.
