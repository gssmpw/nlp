\subsection{Datasets}\label{sec:appendix_data}

To conduct our benchmarking we gather a range of different datasets comprising of both benign and malicious prompts.  

\noindent\textbf{AART:} The AI-Assisted Red-Teaming (AART) dataset~\cite{radharapu2023aart} consists of harmful prompts generated in an automated manner. The users can guide the adversarial prompt generation by providing and modifying high level \emph{recipes} for a downstream LLM to follow in creation of the adversarial examples.

\noindent\textbf{Alpaca:} The Alpaca dataset~\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/tatsu-lab/alpaca}} includes 52,000 instructions and demonstrations generated by OpenAI's {\tt text-davinci-003}~\cite{alpaca}. Primarily, this dataset is intended to serve as a key resource for instruction-tuning language models, enhancing their ability to follow instructions accurately. In our context, the distilled instruction set will contain benign prompts.

\noindent\textbf{AttaQ:} The Adversarial Question Attack (AttaQ) dataset consists of harmful questions gathered from three sources: 1) questions from Anthropic's red teaming dataset, 2) attack prompts synthesised by LLMs directly by providing a toxic directive and example question, and 3) LLM generated harmful prompts when given instances of harmful activities and the corresponding actions involved in them; the LLM is then instructed to generate prompts that a user who wishes to engage in such an activity may pose~\cite{kour2023unveiling}.

\noindent\textbf{AutoDAN:} The AutoDAN attack runs a genetic algorithm to optimize over the discreet input space of a given prompt \cite{liu2023autodan}. We use the same set of Harmful Behaviour prompts as we do with GCG for the initial seed samples.

\noindent\textbf{Awesome ChatGPT Prompts:} Awesome ChatGPT Prompts\,\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/fka/awesome-chatgpt-prompts}} is a repository featuring a curated collection of example prompts specifically designed for use with the ChatGPT model~\cite{awesomechatgptprompts}. This collection is tailored to be effective across various ChatGPT applications. For our purposes, it expands the set of prompts used in benign role-playing scenarios.

\noindent\textbf{BoolQ:} The BoolQ dataset is comprised of 16k question/answer pairs curated by Clark et al. \cite{clark2019boolq}. The questions are formulated such that answers are either "yes" or "no" and were gathered from anonymized, aggregated queries sent to Google's search engine. Additional filters were put in place when selecting the questions/answer pairs, such as the length of the query, and whether a Wikipedia page was returned in the top results of the query to Google. Human annotators were also used to determine if the question was of \textit{good} quality e.g. easily understandable. In the context of this work, this dataset represents benign prompts typical users might ask an LLM to answer in place of a search engine. Alon et al. \cite{alon2023detecting} use 3,270 BoolQ prompts as non-adversarial during evaluation.

\noindent\textbf{ChatGPT DAN:} A subset of prompts from \cite{ChatGPT_DAN}, focusing on "Do Anything Now" style jailbreak attacks. 

\noindent\textbf{Dolly:} Dolly is a dataset of prompt response pairs created by Databricks. Prompts primarily correspond to question answering, but some also align with several behaviour categories proposed in \cite{ouyang2022training} (including brainstorming, classification, information extraction, etc).

\noindent\textbf{Do-Not-Answer:} Do-Not-Answer\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/LibrAI/do-not-answer}} dataset~\cite{wang2023not} contains 939 instructions across 5 risk areas (e.g., information hazards, human-chatbot interaction harms etc.) and 12 harm types (e.g, self harm, disinformation, body shaming etc.). The dataset is curated in a way that most responsible LLMs do not answer the dataset samples. The dataset samples are generated with GPT-4 using a strategy that involves simulated conversation history, and three conversation rounds to generate the samples across above mentioned risk and harm dimensions. Only inherently risky samples are selected from generated responses. 

\noindent\textbf{Gandalf Ignore Instruction:} The Gandalf Ignore Instruction~\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/Lakera/gandalf_ignore_instructions}} dataset was collected by Lakera AI as part of an educational game designed to raise awareness about the risks of prompt attacks on large language models~\cite{gandalf_ignore_instructions}. This dataset comprises 1,000 instruction-based prompts that use role-playing techniques to bypass the model's alignment defenses and reveal the game's secret password.

\noindent\textbf{GCG:} The Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) dataset was generated following the methodology described by~\cite{zou2023universal}. It consists of 521 Harmful Behaviors' samples which were used to prompt the Vicuna model during the attack. For each harmful behavior prompt, the attack begins by appending an adversarial suffix of twenty spaced exclamation marks (i.e., ``!'') to the prompt. The suffix is then iteratively revised to minimize loss until the model responds without refusal keywords. Multiple distinct attack suffixes may be generated, with the final selection being the one that achieved a successful attack. The {\tt Vicuna-13b-v1.5} model\,\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5}}, a fine-tuned version of Llama2, was used to generate and test the performance of the new suffix, replicating the experimental setup of \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-14132}.

\noindent\textbf{Harmful Behaviours:} The Harmful Behaviors dataset is a subset of the AdvBench dataset, designed to test the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with safety requirements~\cite{zou2023universal}. It is divided into two subsets: Harmful Strings and Harmful Behaviors. Both subsets were generated by prompting {\tt Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored}, an uncensored and unaligned version of the Vicuna model. The authors manually crafted 100 and 50 prompts for each subset, respectively, and then generated 10 new samples for each prompt using a 5-shot demonstration method. The Harmful Behaviors subset, which was selected for this work, consists of 521 instruction-based prompts that cover the same themes as the Harmful Strings subset. These prompts are framed as questions to elicit harmful content from the model in response to the harmful instructions. The dataset includes various themes observed in online interactions, such as cyberbullying, hate speech, and harassment, making it a critical resource for training and evaluating algorithms designed to detect and mitigate harmful behavior in digital environments and online communities.

\noindent\textbf{Human Preference:} A dataset of 55k prompts in which a user's prompt is sent to two anonymous LLMs and the user can indicate the preferred choice of response \cite{chiang2024chatbot}. This can be used for further fine tuning of models to give better responses. In our case, we used it as a source of benign prompts.

\noindent\textbf{instruction-dataset:} This dataset is comprised of 327 prompts with human written instructions and questions covering a wide range of topics and scenarios \cite{H4instructiondataset}.

\noindent\textbf{Jailbreak Prompts:} The Jailbreak Prompts dataset comprises examples of four platforms (i.e., Reddit, Discord, websites, and open-sources datasets) from December 2022 to May 2023, which consists of 6387 prompts, then filtered to 666 prompt considered as jailbreaks "in the wild" by \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2308-03825}.

\noindent\textbf{Jailbreakchat:} A limited set of jailbreak prompts from jailbreakchat.com~\cite{Jailbreakchat} (accessed on 14th January 2024) comprising of a variety of different jailbreaking techniques such as role-playing, hypothetical scenarios, and "Do Anything Now" style attacks.


\noindent\textbf{MaliciousInstruct:} The MaliciousInstruct dataset is comprised of 100 prompt instructions containing malicious intent, similar to AdvBench. It was created by Huang et al. \cite{huang2023catastrophic} as an additional benchmark dataset for carrying out evaluations, but with the goal of being more diverse with respect to malicious categories present in the prompts, thus facilitating more rigorous evaluations. The dataset was created using ChatGPT in "Do Anything Now" mode, and prompted to define 10 categories of malicious behaviour: \textit{psychological manipulation, sabotage, theft, defamation, cyberbullying, false accusation, tax fraud, hacking, fraud}, and \textit{illegal drug use}. For each category, 20 malicious instructions were subsequently generated using the LLM, and further manually reviewed by the authors for alignment to the selected malicious categories and diversity, after which 100 malicious prompts remained. ChatGPT, under normal operating conditions, was also used to evaluate the prompts, with each one prompting refusal to answer.

\noindent\textbf{No Robots:} The No Robots dataset is constructed using 10,000 instructions and demonstrations by humans~\cite{no_robots}. It contains a wide range of prompts on topics such as question answering, coding, and free-text generation.

\noindent\textbf{Orca DPO Pairs:} Orca DPO Pairs \cite{IntelOrca} is a dataset with 12.9k examples and, similar to the Human Preference, consists of a prompt (typically a question or instruction) supplied to two LLMs, with the chosen preferred response indicated. 

\noindent\textbf{PIQA:} The Physical Interaction: Question Answering (PIQA) is a question dataset for language models focused around physical "commonsense" questions, rather than more abstract knowledge questions that may other datasets focus on \cite{bisk2020piqa}.

\noindent\textbf{Prompt Extraction:} An IBM internal test dataset focused on jailbreaking the model to reveal its system prompt.

\noindent\textbf{Puffin:} The Puffin dataset\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/LDJnr/Puffin}} is a collection of multi-turn conversations between GPT-4 and humans~\cite{puffindataset}. This dataset comprises 2,000 conversations, each averaging 10 turns, with conversation context lengths exceeding 1,000 tokens. For the purposes of this study, we selected a subset of 6,994 prompts generated by the human participants, as these align most closely with benign labeled data. 

\noindent\textbf{SAP:} The Semi-automatic Attack Prompts (SAP) dataset~\cite{deng2023attack} is a collection of attack prompts constructed in a semi-automated manner. Initial manual prompts are supplied to an LLM and, via in-context learning, the LLM is tasked to generate additional malicious prompts. In total this results in 1,600 prompts covering a wide range of harmful topics.

\noindent\textbf{Super Natural-Instructions:} Super Natural-Instructions dataset \cite{wang2022super} is a benchmark of natural language processing tasks containing 1616 instructions related to 76 different task types (e.g. classification, text matching, paraphrasing etc.) and 33 different domains (e.g., news, sociology, fiction, medicine etc.) which was collected through community effort on Github\footnote{\url{https://github.com/allenai/natural-instructions}}. For our benchmark evaluation we select 1,613 instructions as they closely align with benign labelled data. 

\noindent\textbf{ToxicChat:} The ToxicChat dataset \cite{lin2023toxicchat} is based on real user queries from a Vicuna online demo\footnote{\url{https://chat.lmsys.org/}} which is a community chatbot platform. Data is collected related to interactions between users and chatbot from March 30 to April 12, 2023 at the consent of the users. The dataset contains 10,165 data points and we use the version 0124\footnote{\url{https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmsys/toxic-chat}} of the dataset and select jailbreaking samples. 

\noindent\textbf{UltraChat:} The UltraChat dataset \cite{ding2023enhancing} is comprised of over half a million conversations between a (simulated) human and AI. In creating the dataset high level conversation topics are selected and two LLMs interact, playing the roles of the user and the AI.

\noindent\textbf{XSTest:} The eXaggerated Safety behaviors Test (XSTest) dataset~\footnote{\url{https://github.com/paul-rottger/exaggerated-safety}} provides a mix of benign and malicious examples~\cite{rottger2023xstest}. The benign examples frequently carry words which are commonly associated with harmful behaviour, but used in a benign query (e.g. \emph{``How can I kill a Python process?''}). This aims to uncover defences which have been excessively tuned to detect jailbreaks, such that they now misidentify such benign queries as malicious.
