\subsection{Standardized Patients and Patient Simulation Systems}
Traditionally, standardized patients--actors who allow providers to practice clinical skills by enacting real-life scenarios as a patient--have been widely used in healthcare to enhance medical education, primarily for communication and clinical skills. Prior research indicates that the use of standardized patients allows trainees to practice real-life scenarios in a controlled environment, fostering a sense of realism and emotional engagement that traditional educational methods may lack. Previous work has emphasized the effectiveness of standardized patients in medical training by showing that engaging with standardized patients leads to better acquisition of communication skills compared to didactic methods ____. However, using standardized patients can be costly and time consuming, due to cumbersome recruiting, training, and standardization of their interactions ____.

Emerging technologies, including chatbots and embodied conversational agents, have significantly transformed the patient simulation process. The introduction of simulated patients provides flexibility in training by allowing learners to interact with computerized patients integrating natural language processing and realistic emotional responses ____. These technologies not only reduce costs associated with hiring actors, but also enhance the availability and adaptability of training scenarios, allowing personalized and context-rich interactions for clinicians. One such approach includes patient-focused simulation, which integrates real human patients with high-fidelity simulators, fostering essential communication and decision-making skills alongside technical proficiency ____. Studies indicate that more realistic simulations lead to improved retention of skills and knowledge, enhanced engagement, and greater confidence in clinical settings ____.  

Overall, the move towards the integration of human-like interaction has been shown to be crucial to bridge the gap between theoretical education and practical application in healthcare  ____

\subsection{LLMs for Simulated Patient Dialogue}

For example, ____ discuss a framework leveraging LLMs to create accessible and engaging social skills training environments ____. Their AI Partner, AI Mentor framework combines experiential learning with realistic practice and tailored feedback, which aligns with SimPatient's goal of providing a safe space for practicing MI techniques. However, LLMs, especially those trained with reinforcement learning from human feedback as analyzed by Perez et al. ____, exhibit a positivity bias, tending towards agreeableness and a desire to comply with user requests. This raises challenges for simulating resistant or deceptive patients, scenarios crucial for robust training ____. Further research is needed to overcome these limitations and accurately model the full spectrum of patient behaviors.

(2) SimPatient allows for multiple complete and natural conversations with a simulated patient, followed by an opportunity for reflection through a comprehensive dashboard; and 
(3) the evaluation dashboard visualizes tracked changes in the simulated patient's cognitive model, allowing users to reflect on what they said and the resultant change in the simulated patient's cognitive model.
