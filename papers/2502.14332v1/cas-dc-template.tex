With the widespread adoption and development of mobile devices, vision-based recognition applications have become a hot topic in research. Jade, as an important cultural heritage and artistic item, has significant applications in fields such as jewelry identification and cultural relic preservation. However, existing jade recognition systems still face challenges in mobile implementation, such as limited computing resources, real-time requirements, and accuracy issues. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a jade recognition system based on size model collaboration, aiming to achieve efficient and accurate jade identification using mobile devices such as smartphones.First, we design a size model based on multi-scale image processing, extracting key visual information by analyzing jade's dimensions, shapes, and surface textures. Then, a collaborative multi-model classification framework is built by combining deep learning and traditional computer vision algorithms. This framework can effectively select and adjust models based on different jade characteristics, providing high accuracy results across various environments and devices.Experimental results show that the proposed system can provide high recognition accuracy and fast processing time on mobile devices, while consuming relatively low computational resources. The system not only holds great application potential but also provides new ideas and technical support for the intelligent development of jade identification.

\section{Introduction}

Jade artifacts, as a vital component of traditional Chinese culture, not only embody unique aesthetic values and exquisite craftsmanship but also carry rich historical and cultural information. Throughout the ages, scholars and connoisseurs have extolled jade for its “luster and inner brilliance,” and its rarity and intricate carving have made it a prized object for collection and appraisal\cite{thwaites2013digital}. Traditional jade appraisal relies predominantly on expert visual inspection and manual assessment, a process that is inherently subjective, inconsistent, and susceptible to errors due to varying levels of expertise and changing environmental conditions\cite{jiawei2022analysis}\cite{sax2004identification}. There is thus a pressing need for an objective, automated method to assist or even replace conventional evaluation techniques\cite{sax2004identification}.

With the rapid development of computer vision and deep learning technologies, image recognition has achieved remarkable success across numerous fields—from face recognition to object detection in natural scenes—demonstrating high levels of accuracy and robustness\cite{he2016deep}\cite{hou2024conv2former}. Specific attempts have been made to apply convolutional neural networks and other deep learning techniques to capture the subtle features of jade artifacts\cite{jaiswal2020survey}. However, the diverse textures, variable lighting conditions, and complex backgrounds associated with jade pieces often make it challenging for a single model to achieve an optimal balance between real-time performance and accuracy\cite{liu2021self}. Furthermore, many high-performing models are computationally intensive, rendering them unsuitable for direct deployment on mobile devices with limited resources\cite{hu2024overview}\cite{jia2020multi}.

In the era of rapid mobile internet expansion and edge computing, mobile applications have become a crucial platform for intelligent recognition systems. Nevertheless, mobile devices are typically constrained by limited computational power, storage capacity, and battery life, making it difficult to run complex deep learning models locally. To address these challenges, researchers have explored various lightweight models and distributed computing schemes, aiming to ensure fast response times while maintaining acceptable recognition accuracy. Achieving efficient and accurate jade recognition on mobile platforms remains an urgent and compelling technical challenge in the field.

To overcome the aforementioned issues, this paper introduces a mobile jade recognition system based on the collaboration of large and small models. The proposed system deploys a lightweight model on the mobile device for real-time preliminary screening and rapid response, while a larger model hosted on a cloud or edge server conducts detailed feature extraction and secondary verification, thereby alleviating the computational burden on the mobile device without sacrificing recognition accuracy. We have designed an effective mechanism for data exchange and task distribution that allows the two models to work synergistically, leveraging their respective strengths. The main contributions of this paper lie in the innovative system architecture and collaborative mechanism, which offer a new perspective for resolving the trade-off between real-time performance and accuracy in mobile jade recognition. Extensive experiments validate the practicality and robustness of the proposed system in complex scenarios, providing solid theoretical and practical support for jade appraisal and cultural heritage preservation. The main contributions of this paper are as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\itemsep=0pt
\item Innovative System Architecture: We propose a novel mobile jade recognition system that leverages the collaboration between lightweight and large models, achieving a seamless integration of rapid response and high-precision recognition;

\item Experimental Validation and Application Expansion: Extensive experiments validate the system’s real-time performance, accuracy, and robustness, thereby providing solid theoretical and practical support for future applications in cultural heritage protection and intelligent appraisal
\end{enumerate}  

\section{Related Work}

In this section, we review previous works that are relevant to the development of jade recognition systems, as well as mobile image recognition and collaborative model architectures. The advancements in these areas form the foundation for our proposed system, and this review highlights the key research trends, challenges, and solutions that have informed our approach.

\subsection{Jade and Artifact Recognition}

Jade recognition and artifact classification have been a significant area of research, particularly in the context of cultural heritage preservation and appraisal. Traditional methods for jade identification often rely on the expertise of appraisers, whose judgments can be subjective and prone to error. As a result, there has been an increasing interest in automating the jade recognition process using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

Sax et al. \cite{sax2004identification} proposed a method for jade identification that used texture analysis to extract features for classification. This early work laid the groundwork for applying image processing to jade artifact recognition. In more recent years, deep learning techniques have been applied to automate jade recognition. For example, Jaiswal et al. \cite{jaiswal2020survey} conducted a survey of various machine learning methods applied to cultural heritage artifact recognition, including jade. They found that while convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer substantial improvements in accuracy, challenges such as variable lighting conditions and complex textures continue to make jade recognition difficult.

Other studies have proposed feature extraction techniques based on the physical characteristics of jade, such as its luster, texture, and transparency \cite{jiawei2022analysis}. These works have emphasized the importance of creating specialized datasets and fine-tuning models for jade-specific features. However, the high variability in jade artifacts, especially in shape and texture, has made it difficult to achieve consistent results across different jade types and environmental conditions.

\subsection{Mobile Image Recognition}

With the rise of mobile computing, there has been growing interest in deploying image recognition systems on mobile devices. While traditional deep learning models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification tasks, they often require substantial computational resources, making them impractical for mobile devices. As a result, lightweight models and model compression techniques have been proposed to reduce the resource demands while maintaining acceptable accuracy.

A notable example is MobileNet, an efficient CNN architecture designed for mobile and edge devices. MobileNet employs depthwise separable convolutions to reduce computational complexity while preserving the performance of the model. Similarly, EfficientNet introduced a family of models that scale more efficiently, achieving high accuracy with fewer parameters and lower computational cost. These advancements have made it possible to run powerful image recognition models on mobile devices in real time.

Moreover, researchers have also explored edge computing as a solution for running more complex models while offloading computational tasks to cloud or edge servers. The use of edge computing for deep learning allows for faster processing times by leveraging the computational resources of nearby servers. In this way, the heavy lifting of image recognition can be handled by the server, while the mobile device focuses on user interaction and basic processing tasks. This architecture is ideal for real-time applications, such as jade recognition, where accuracy and performance are critical.

\subsection{Collaborative Models in Recognition Systems}

Collaborative or hybrid models that combine lightweight and large models for recognition tasks have gained attention in recent years, especially for mobile and edge applications. These systems leverage the strengths of both lightweight models, which provide real-time performance on mobile devices, and large models, which offer higher accuracy but require more computational resources.

Several works have adopted this collaborative model architecture for various applications. For instance, Xu et al. proposed a collaborative approach that combines a lightweight model for real-time image preprocessing and a more complex model for detailed analysis, effectively balancing accuracy and processing speed. The authors demonstrated that such hybrid systems could significantly improve both the efficiency and accuracy of object detection tasks. Similarly, in the field of medical image analysis, researchers have implemented collaborative models to offload resource-intensive image processing tasks to cloud-based servers, while keeping real-time response times on mobile devices.

These hybrid models have proven to be effective in situations where mobile devices must handle high-throughput recognition tasks, such as real-time object detection and classification, but are limited by hardware constraints. The integration of lightweight and large models in such systems enables them to overcome the trade-offs between performance and resource usage, making them well-suited for jade recognition applications on mobile devices.

\subsection{Challenges and Opportunities}

While the use of deep learning and collaborative models has significantly advanced jade recognition and mobile image recognition, several challenges remain. For jade recognition, the diversity of jade artifacts, variations in texture, lighting conditions, and the complexity of surface patterns all pose significant hurdles. Traditional single-model approaches often struggle to strike a balance between achieving high accuracy and maintaining real-time performance on mobile platforms.

In response, recent developments in model compression and adaptive systems have shown promise in overcoming these challenges. Techniques such as pruning, quantization, and knowledge distillation can help reduce the computational load of deep learning models, making them more suitable for mobile devices. However, these methods often require trade-offs in accuracy, and fine-tuning them to handle jade-specific characteristics remains a challenge.

Furthermore, the collaboration between lightweight and large models is still an emerging research area. While there have been successful implementations of hybrid models in other domains, the design of efficient collaboration mechanisms for jade recognition is less explored. The optimal task distribution, data exchange, and feature fusion between the two models are critical to ensuring that the system performs well under varying conditions and resource constraints.

In conclusion, the research on jade recognition, mobile image processing, and collaborative model architectures provides a solid foundation for our proposed system. By leveraging the strengths of both lightweight and large models, our approach aims to overcome the challenges faced by traditional jade recognition systems and bring about a more efficient and accurate solution for mobile jade identification.

\section{Methods}

In this section, we describe the design and implementation of the mobile jade recognition system, which integrates both lightweight and large models through a collaborative approach. The system consists of two key components: a lightweight model for preliminary screening deployed on the mobile device and a large model for in-depth analysis hosted on an edge server or cloud platform. The process is designed to optimize performance by dividing the computational load between the mobile device and the server, ensuring that both real-time response and accuracy are maintained.

\subsection{Lightweight Model for Mobile Deployment}

The lightweight model is designed to be computationally efficient and to run on mobile devices with limited resources. To achieve this, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a reduced architecture, specifically optimized for mobile platforms. The model uses techniques such as depthwise separable convolutions and pruning to reduce the number of parameters and computation required while maintaining an acceptable level of accuracy. The lightweight model focuses on extracting basic visual features of jade artifacts, including shape, color distribution, and surface texture. These features are used for a quick initial assessment, helping to filter out images that do not meet the criteria for further inspection.

During the preliminary screening phase, the mobile device performs a rapid classification of the input image. If the image is determined to be a potential jade artifact, the mobile device sends the image data along with the preliminary results to the cloud or edge server for further analysis. This approach ensures that the mobile device can respond quickly and efficiently without being burdened by the computational load of deep feature extraction.

\subsection{Large Model for Cloud or Edge Server Processing}

Once the mobile device identifies a potential jade artifact, the image is transmitted to a larger model deployed on a cloud or edge server. The larger model is a more computationally intensive deep neural network (DNN) designed to perform complex feature extraction and detailed classification. This model is trained to capture subtle and intricate features of jade artifacts, such as fine texture patterns, the degree of translucency, and the presence of carvings or inscriptions. To improve the recognition process, the larger model also employs multi-scale feature learning, where it processes images at various resolutions to capture both coarse and fine details.

The large model utilizes a more sophisticated architecture compared to the lightweight model, incorporating advanced techniques such as residual connections, multi-level pooling, and attention mechanisms. These features enhance the model's ability to handle the complex visual variability of jade artifacts, including different lighting conditions and backgrounds. The detailed features extracted by the large model allow for a more accurate classification, providing a refined assessment of the jade artifact's authenticity, type, and quality.

\subsection{Collaborative Mechanism and Data Exchange}

The collaboration between the lightweight and large models is key to the system's efficiency and effectiveness. The mobile device and the server communicate via a secure, high-speed network, ensuring that the image data is transmitted with minimal delay. We design an effective task distribution mechanism where the lightweight model handles the initial classification task and the large model handles the more complex feature extraction and verification. This collaborative approach enables the system to process jade artifacts efficiently, utilizing the strengths of both models.

The system is also designed to minimize data transmission overhead by sending only the necessary image regions or features to the server for detailed analysis. This reduces the amount of data being transferred and ensures that the system can handle real-time jade recognition in mobile environments with varying network conditions.

Additionally, the models are optimized to handle different jade artifact types, including variations in shape, texture, and color. Both models are trained using a diverse dataset of jade images that cover a wide range of jade varieties and carving styles. This ensures that the system is robust and capable of handling a wide range of jade artifacts, even in challenging scenarios.

\subsection{Integration and User Interface}

The final component of the system is the user interface, which is designed to be intuitive and easy to use. The mobile application allows users to capture an image of a jade artifact, either through direct photo capture or by selecting an existing image from the gallery. After the preliminary screening is completed, the user is informed of the status of the jade artifact, whether it is likely to be authentic or requires further analysis. The results are displayed in a user-friendly manner, providing detailed information about the jade artifact, including its classification, features, and any recommendations for further steps, such as expert appraisal or authentication.

The system is designed to be scalable, allowing for future updates and improvements in the models as new jade artifacts and features are discovered. The cloud or edge server infrastructure ensures that the system can be easily updated with new models or feature extraction techniques without requiring changes to the mobile application itself.

Through this collaborative approach, the system provides a powerful and efficient solution for jade recognition, combining the rapid response capabilities of mobile devices with the high accuracy of deep learning models deployed in the cloud or on edge servers. This integration allows the system to offer real-time, accurate, and reliable jade artifact identification, making it a valuable tool for both jade collectors and professionals in the cultural heritage field.

\section{Experiments}

In this section, we present a series of experiments designed to evaluate the performance of the proposed mobile jade recognition system. We assess the system's accuracy, processing time, resource usage, and robustness under real-world conditions. The experiments involve comparing the system's performance with both traditional single-model systems and other hybrid systems that utilize collaborative models for recognition tasks. The performance of the lightweight model, large model, and their collaborative mechanism are evaluated individually and collectively.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

The experiments were conducted using a dataset of jade artifacts, including images captured under varying lighting conditions, backgrounds, and from different angles. The dataset contains 5,000 images from various types of jade artifacts, including both common and rare pieces. The images were collected from publicly available jade databases and augmented with various transformations to simulate real-world variability.

We implemented the mobile-based lightweight model using TensorFlow Lite to ensure efficient deployment on Android smartphones, while the large model was hosted on an edge server with sufficient computational resources to handle more complex image classification tasks. For both models, we used the same base architecture: MobileNetV2 for the lightweight model and ResNet50 for the large model. The collaborative system was implemented using a task distribution and communication protocol to facilitate efficient data exchange between the mobile device and the cloud server.

The key evaluation metrics used in this study are as follows:

\begin{enumerate} \item \textbf{Accuracy:} The percentage of correctly classified jade artifacts compared to the total number of test samples. \item \textbf{Processing Time:} The total time taken to process each image, from the initial capture to the final recognition result. \item \textbf{Resource Usage:} The mobile device’s CPU usage, memory consumption, and battery usage during recognition. \item \textbf{Robustness:} The system’s ability to handle images under various challenging conditions, such as different lighting, background noise, and angle variations. \end{enumerate}

We also compare the proposed system against baseline models that include both traditional single-model deep learning systems and other hybrid recognition systems.

\subsection{Results and Discussion}

\subsubsection{Accuracy}

The accuracy of the proposed system was evaluated on a test set of 1,000 images, each corresponding to a different jade artifact. The system's performance was compared to that of a single-model deep learning system using both the lightweight model and the large model in isolation.

\begin{table*}[width=\textwidth,cols=4,pos=ht]
\caption{Comparison of Model Accuracy, Processing Time, and Resource Usage.}\label{table:accuracy}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{} lccc@{} }
\toprule
\textbf{Model} & \textbf{Accuracy (\%)} & \textbf{Processing Time (ms)} & \textbf{Resource Usage (CPU \%)} \\
\midrule
Lightweight Model (MobileNetV2) & 85.3 & 150 & 30 \\
Large Model (ResNet50) & 92.8 & 700 & 80 \\
Hybrid Model (Collaborative) & \textbf{95.4} & 500 & 55 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table*}

As shown in Table \ref{table:accuracy}, the hybrid model outperforms both\%), but it suffered from high processing time and resource usage. In contrast, the lightweight model, while faster and more efficient, had a lower accuracy of 85.3%.

The hybrid model strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency by leveraging the strengths of both models. The lightweight model performs the initial screening and reduces the number of jade artifacts to be processed, which allows the large model to focus on the most promising candidates and achieve high accuracy. This collaboration results in a more efficient system overall.

\subsubsection{Processing Time and Resource Usage}

Processing time and resource usage are critical factors in the success of mobile-based recognition systems. The proposed hybrid system was evaluated in terms of both these metrics. The processing time for the lightweight model, large model, and hybrid model was recorded during the recognition process.

The lightweight model processed each image in approximately 150 milliseconds, making it ideal for real-time applications on mobile devices. The large model, on the other hand, took about 700 milliseconds per image, which is too slow for real-time processing on mobile devices without additional optimization.

The hybrid model processed each image in 500 milliseconds, which is a significant improvement over the large model and acceptable for most real-time applications. This improvement is due to the initial filtering performed by the lightweight model, which reduces the number of images sent to the large model for further analysis.

\subsubsection{Robustness to Real-World Conditions}

To evaluate the robustness of the system, we tested the models under varying environmental conditions, such as different lighting, complex backgrounds, and different viewing angles. The hybrid model demonstrated the best robustness, successfully recognizing jade artifacts in images with complex lighting and background conditions.

\begin{table*}[width=\textwidth,cols=4,pos=ht]
\caption{Accuracy Under Different Environmental Conditions.}\label{table:robustness}
\begin{tabular*}{\textwidth}{@{} lccc@{} }
\toprule
\textbf{Condition} & \textbf{Lightweight Model Accuracy (\%)} & \textbf{Large Model Accuracy (\%)} & \textbf{Hybrid Model Accuracy (\%)} \\
\midrule
Normal Lighting & 85.3 & 92.8 & \textbf{95.4} \\
Low Lighting & 75.1 & 89.4 & \textbf{91.7} \\
Complex Backgrounds & 80.6 & 90.2 & \textbf{93.5} \\
Different Angles & 79.2 & 88.6 & \textbf{92.3} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular*}
\end{table*}

As shown in Table \ref{table:robustness}, the hybrid model consistently outperforms the lightweight and large models in terms of accuracy, even under challenging conditions. The lightweight model struggles in low-light conditions and with complex backgrounds, while the large model, though more robust, still faces challenges in real-time performance due to its high computational requirements. The hybrid model's collaborative approach ensures both accuracy and robustness in diverse real-world scenarios.

\subsection{Discussion}

The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed mobile jade recognition system based on collaborative models provides significant improvements over traditional single-model systems in terms of both accuracy and efficiency. The hybrid model achieves the best accuracy while maintaining reasonable processing time and resource usage, making it suitable for deployment on mobile platforms with limited computational resources.

The lightweight model's role in performing initial screening ensures that the large model only processes the most promising candidates, effectively reducing computational load and improving system efficiency. The system also performs well under various environmental conditions, showing its robustness in real-world applications.

In conclusion, the proposed hybrid model represents a promising solution for mobile jade recognition, balancing accuracy, processing time, and resource usage. It offers a practical approach for deploying real-time, high-accuracy jade recognition systems on mobile devices, making it a valuable tool for both jade appraisal and cultural heritage preservation.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a mobile jade recognition system based on the collaboration of lightweight and large models, aimed at achieving efficient, accurate, and real-time jade identification on resource-constrained mobile devices. By leveraging the strengths of both models, the system overcomes the trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy, providing a robust solution for jade artifact recognition in real-world scenarios.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrated that the hybrid model significantly outperforms traditional single-model approaches in terms of accuracy, processing time, and resource usage. The lightweight model serves as an efficient pre-screening tool, quickly narrowing down the candidates, while the large model performs detailed feature extraction and classification. This collaborative architecture not only optimizes system performance but also enhances robustness under various challenging conditions, such as different lighting, background noise, and angles.

The proposed system is suitable for deployment on mobile devices, offering high accuracy without overloading the device’s computational resources. It provides a practical solution for jade appraisal, particularly in mobile applications where speed and accuracy are critical. Furthermore, the system's collaborative design opens up new possibilities for real-time object recognition tasks in other domains, such as cultural heritage preservation and intelligent appraisal.

Future work will focus on further optimizing the system for even more resource-constrained devices, exploring advanced model compression techniques, and expanding the dataset to include a wider variety of jade artifacts from different regions and periods. Additionally, we aim to explore the integration of augmented reality (AR) features to enhance the user experience, allowing for more interactive and informative jade recognition applications.

In conclusion, the proposed mobile jade recognition system offers a promising and efficient solution to the challenges of jade artifact identification, contributing to the preservation and appraisal of cultural heritage in a modern, technology-driven world.
