\subsection{LLM-based Agents}
LLM-based agents are systems that leverage large language models (LLMs) for autonomous reasoning, planning, and task execution using external tools ____. 
These agents integrate LLMs as core controllers to manage complex workflows, enabling them to perceive, plan, act, and learn within a defined scope ____. 
Unlike traditional LLMs, agents autonomously plan and execute tasks, enabling goal-directed automation in real-world applications ____. 
For instance, the agent may adapt to household environments by responding to lighting conditions and anticipating tool locations for task execution ____. Similarly, automatic shopping agents interact with users to understand preferences, recommend products, and track price fluctuations, alerting users when the optimal purchase time arrives ____.
Recent advancements, such as HuggingGPT ____, AutoGPT ____, and ChatDev ____ further demonstrate the growing potential of LLMs in automating workflows and supporting decision-making.

\subsection{Backdoor Attacks}
A backdoor in deep learning embeds an exploit during training, invoked by a specific trigger ____. Early research focused on computer vision ____, which was later expanded to natural language processing ____. 
More recently, backdoor attacks have emerged as a significant threat to LLMs ____. 
Backdoor attacks can be categorized into data poisoning ____ and model poisoning  ____. 
LLM-based agents relying on LLMs as core controllers are susceptible to both types of attacks ____. 
However, backdoor attacks on agents differ from those targeting traditional LLMs, as agents perform multi-step reasoning and interact with the environment ____. 
This extended reasoning process creates more opportunities for sophisticated attacks, such as query-attack, observation-attack, and thought-attack ____.
