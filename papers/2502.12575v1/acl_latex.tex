% The development of LLM-based agents has become increasingly prevalent. 
As LLM-based agents become increasingly prevalent, backdoors can be implanted into agents through user queries or environment feedback, raising critical concerns regarding safety vulnerabilities.
However, backdoor attacks are typically detectable by safety audits that analyze the reasoning process of agents. 
To this end, we propose a novel backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}. 
Specifically, we introduce dynamic encryption, which maps the backdoor into benign content, effectively circumventing safety audits.
To enhance stealthiness, we further decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. 
Based on these advancements, backdoors are allowed to bypass safety audits significantly.
Additionally, we present AgentBackdoorEval, a dataset designed for the comprehensive evaluation of agent backdoor attacks.
Experimental results across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an attack success rate nearing 100\% while maintaining a detection rate of 0\%, illustrating its effectiveness in evading safety audits.
Our findings highlight the limitations of existing safety mechanisms in detecting advanced attacks, underscoring the urgent need for more robust defenses against backdoor threats.

\section{Introduction}
Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable performance \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport}, catalyzing the extensive deployment of LLM-based agents across various domains \cite{xi2023risepotentiallargelanguage}.   
These agents excel in understanding and planning complex tasks by utilizing external tools and memory storage to access historical context \cite{yao2023react, NEURIPS2023_d842425e}. 
Despite their impressive capabilities, LLM-based agents also pose unprecedented safety challenges \cite{he2024emergedsecurityprivacyllm}, including jailbreak \cite{li2024personalllmagentsinsights}, misinformation \cite{Huang_2025}, and knowledge poisoning \cite{263874}. 
Such vulnerabilities have raised serious concerns regarding the safety of LLM-based agents.

LLM backdoor attacks \cite{kurita-etal-2020-weight}, a typical risk, involve injecting a backdoor into the target model, causing it to behave benignly unless triggered by specific conditions that induce malicious behavior \cite{chen2021badnl,yang-etal-2021-careful}. 
In contrast to backdoor attacks targeting individual LLMs, those in agent-based scenarios manifest in distinct forms \cite{he2024emergedsecurityprivacyllm,wang2024uniquesecurityprivacythreats}. 
Recent research explores methods such as embedding hidden triggers within user interactions or environmental feedback, achieving notable attack success rate, portability, and performance of normal tasks \cite{yang2024watch,wang-etal-2024-badagent,anonymous2024advweb}. 
However, previous work lacks stealth, as backdoor attack contents are stored in memory without additional processing, making them easily detectable through safety audits and oversight mechanisms.

In this paper, we propose a backdoor implantation strategy called \textbf{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}, designed to circumvent safety audits. 
First, the backdoor content in our \textbf{Dynamic Encryption Mechanism} evolves alongside the agent's running process. 
The encrypted content is seamlessly integrated into the agent's workflow, remaining hidden throughout the process. 
To enhance stealth, we introduce \textbf{Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI)}, which leverages anchor tokens and overlapping concatenation to decompose the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments that poison the agent's tools. 
These fragments are encrypted and implanted through tiered implantation within the agent's workflow, activated through cumulative triggering, ensuring they are difficult to trigger by arbitrary user queries. 
Through these algorithms, our method achieves exceptional stealth and a high attack success rate. 
It performs effectively across various scenarios and datasets, with a focus on its ability to bypass safety audits and execute attack behavior. 
Compared to other backdoor attack algorithms, our method remains undetectable, as demonstrated in our memory inspection experiments where it achieved a 0\% detection rate, underscoring its superior stealth and threat potential.

Additionally, we introduce a dedicated dataset called \textbf{AgentBackdoorEval} designed to evaluate the effectiveness of adversarial backdoor attacks. 
To ensure a comprehensive assessment, the dataset covers five real-world scenarios in which agents may be deployed, including Banking Finance, E-commerce, Medical, Social Media, and Weather Query. Each task within these scenarios represents a request that users might make of agents in real-world applications. 
We also incorporate various simulation tools to facilitate tool calls for every scenario. 
Furthermore, automated generation prompts are created for both the data and tools, enabling the scalable expansion of the dataset and the coverage of additional domains.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:

1. \textbf{Dynamic Encryption:} We introduce a novel encryption mechanism for backdoor attacks that allows the attack content to bypass safety audits.

2. \textbf{Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI):} We propose an advanced mechanism that enhances stealth and ensures activation only under carefully designed conditions.

3. \textbf{A Dataset for Evaluating Backdoor Attacks:} We introduce a specialized dataset that provides comprehensive testing scenarios to evaluate the resilience of LLM-based agents against sophisticated backdoor attacks.

\subsection{LLM-based Agents}
LLM-based agents are systems that leverage large language models (LLMs) for autonomous reasoning, planning, and task execution using external tools \cite{Asurveyonlargelanguagemodelbasedautonomousagents,muthusamy-etal-2023-towards}. 
These agents integrate LLMs as core controllers to manage complex workflows, enabling them to perceive, plan, act, and learn within a defined scope \cite{xi2023risepotentiallargelanguage}. 
Unlike traditional LLMs, agents autonomously plan and execute tasks, enabling goal-directed automation in real-world applications \cite{GenerativeAgents}. 
For instance, the agent may adapt to household environments by responding to lighting conditions and anticipating tool locations for task execution \cite{wu2023planeliminatetrack}. Similarly, automatic shopping agents interact with users to understand preferences, recommend products, and track price fluctuations, alerting users when the optimal purchase time arrives \cite{NEURIPS2022_82ad13ec}.
Recent advancements, such as HuggingGPT \cite{NEURIPS2023_77c33e6a}, AutoGPT \cite{yang2023autogptonlinedecisionmaking}, and ChatDev \cite{qian-etal-2024-chatdev} further demonstrate the growing potential of LLMs in automating workflows and supporting decision-making.

\subsection{Backdoor Attacks}
A backdoor in deep learning embeds an exploit during training, invoked by a specific trigger \cite{gao2020backdoorattackscountermeasuresdeep,9743317}. Early research focused on computer vision \cite{gu2019badnetsidentifyingvulnerabilitiesmachine}, which was later expanded to natural language processing \cite{chen2021badnl,qi-etal-2021-hidden,kurita-etal-2020-weight}. 
More recently, backdoor attacks have emerged as a significant threat to LLMs \cite{xu-etal-2024-instructions,yan-etal-2024-backdooring}. 
Backdoor attacks can be categorized into data poisoning \cite{xu-etal-2024-instructions} and model poisoning  \cite{li2024badedit}. 
LLM-based agents relying on LLMs as core controllers are susceptible to both types of attacks \cite{xi2023risepotentiallargelanguage}. 
However, backdoor attacks on agents differ from those targeting traditional LLMs, as agents perform multi-step reasoning and interact with the environment \cite{he2024emergedsecurityprivacyllm}. 
This extended reasoning process creates more opportunities for sophisticated attacks, such as query-attack, observation-attack, and thought-attack \cite{yang2024watch}.

\section{Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack}
\subsection{Preliminary}
We explore our agent within the context of a widely adopted agent framework, ReAct \cite{yao2023react}.
In constructing agents, the LLM is denoted as \(I_{L}\), the user's query as \(q\), and the memory as \(I_{m}\), which stores context across steps. 
The agent's process begins by initializing \(I_{m}\) with \(q\). 
The ReAct process consists of three phases at each step $i$:
the thought generated by \(I_{L}\), the agent's action, the observation from the environment \cite{yang2024watch}.
% 当时间处于i的时候
% the thought generated by \(I_{L}\), denoted as \(t_{i}\); the agent's action, denoted as \(a_{i}\); and the observation from the environment \cite{yang2024watch}, denoted as \(o_{i}\).

% i是时间作为下角标；I什么东西是model/agent自带的；mathcal是你发明的

% In each time step $i$, $I_{m}$ is passed as the context of input to $I_{L}$ to assist the model's reasoning and generate the thought $t_{i}$.
% The tool set $I_{s}$ provides tools, from which a specific tool $s_{i}$ is selected based on $T_{i}$ during $a_{i}$ and store it in $I_{m}$ for the next $t_{i}$ during $o_{i}$.

The process continues until a termination result $R$ is reached, at which point the final memory state is processed by \(I_{L}\) to generate the final answer \(A\).
% 此时R in A, 这个一直处理，直到达到最终条件C，I_{L}(A) = C
The workflow of the agent can be defined as Alg.\ref{alg:react_algorithm}

\begin{algorithm}[t]

\textbf{Input:} UserQuery \( q \), ToolSet \(I_{s}\)

\subsection{Dynamically Encryption Mechanism}
\label{Dynamically Encryption Mechanism}
% 你的第一句，首先应该简介一下，你的方法
% 1 能干啥
% 2 怎么干的
% 才是目的
% 首先，我们介绍动态加密机制，使得随着agent执行过程中，随时间变化的同时，加密内容不同（思路，写成两句话）。

% Our method employs a covert dynamic encryption mechanism to maintain the integrity of the Agent's workflow while seamlessly incorporating additional code \(C_{b}\), such as downloading files, modifying system observations, or accessing specific web pages. 
% The mechanism ensures that the operation remains undetectable and minimizes traceability.

In this section, we introduce a dynamic encryption mechanism that ensures the encrypted content evolves with the agent's workflow. 
By using time-dependent encryption, the content is altered as the agent progresses, with backdoor code set \(C_b\) being encrypted throughout the process.

First, We designed an encryptor \(\mathbb{E}\) to generate the encrypted content set \(C_{e}\) using an injective mapping function \(f\), defined as:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        &\forall c_{b} \in C_{b}, \exists c_{e} \in C_{e} , c_{e} = \mathbb{E}(c_{b}) = f(c_{b}),\\
        % &f({c}_{b})=f({c'}_{b})\Rightarrow {c}_{b}= {c'}_{b},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
% The function \(f\) incorporates the current timestamp \(t\) to generate the encrypted content \(c_{e}\), ensuring that the encryption is dynamic and unique.
% This encryption strategy guarantees that the generated content is both time-sensitive and non-reproducible. 
% The encryptor \(\mathbb{E}\) serves as the implementation of \(f\) mapping \(C_{b}\) to \(C_{e}\), thereby executing the dynamic encryption process.
Our function \(f(\cdot)\) employs time-dependent encoding to transform the backdoor code \(c_{b}\) into the encrypted content \(c_{e}\), where \(c_{e}\) represents the timestamp at the current time of encryption, ensuring that the encryption is both time-sensitive and non-reproducible. 
The encryptor \(\mathbb{E}\) implements \(f(\cdot)\), mapping \(C_{b}\) to \(C_{e}\) and executing the encryption process.
% \begin{equation}
%     c_{e}(t) = \mathcal{E}_t(c_{b}) = f_t(c_{b}).
% \end{equation}
% 加密
% 密码表T_t
We dynamically store the corresponding key-value pairs of \(c_{e}\) in an  encryption table \(\mathbb{T}\) within temporary storage:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        \mathbb{T} &= \bigcup_{k=1}^N \{ (c_{e}^k,c_{b}^k) \mid c_{e}^k = f(c_{b}^k) \},
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where \(N\) is the total number of key-value pairs.

% The map table is securely hidden from both users and Agent programs. The time-dependent nature of the encryption ensures unique results for different timestamps.

% 为了便于理解，我们建模一个有限自动状态机，用于描述密码表T_t在Agent's workflow中的 life cycle:
For ease of understanding, we model a finite state machine (FSM) \cite{533956} to describe the life cycle of the encryption table \(\mathbb{T}\) in the agent's workflow:
\begin{align}
FSM_T = (\mathcal{S}, \Sigma, \delta, s_0, F),
\end{align}
where \(\mathcal{S}\) represents the states of the encryption table, which can be \(inactive\), \(active\), or \(destroyed\). 
The set \(\Sigma\) denotes the events that trigger state transitions, specifically \(initialize\), \(execute\), and \(terminate\). The transition function \(\delta: \mathcal{S} \times \Sigma \to \mathcal{S}\) defines how the states change in response to these events. 
Upon completion of the agent's workflow, the encryption table is destroyed,  as indicated by \(\mathbb{T} \xrightarrow{delete} \emptyset\).

Our design ensures the creation of a time-dependent, dynamically encrypted algorithm that is immediately discarded and adapts to the evolving workflow of the agent.

% This design ensures that the map table becomes undetectable, even through memory auditing mechanisms.

% 3.2保证的是我们能构建一个： 根据时间，动态加密的，即刻销毁的，随着agent工作流走的一个加密算法

% Then, We define an intrusion prefix $\mathbb{I}_{p}$ which is appended before \(c_{e}\). 
% The intrusion prefix can ensure the subsequent extraction of the encrypted content. 

% In each iteration \(k\), if \(c_{b}\) exists, \(c_{e}\) is computed using \(\mathbb{E}\) and incorporated into \(I_{m}^{k}\) along with \(P_{\mathrm{i}}\). 

% This ensures covert processing of \(c_{b}\) while maintaining the integrity of the Agent's workflow. 

% The incorporation process is formalized as follows:

% \begin{algorithm}[H]
% \caption{Implantation Process}
% \label{alg:Implantation Process}
% \textbf{Input:} Tool set \(I_{s}\), Initial memory \(I_{m}^{0}\)

% \textbf{Output:} Final memory \(I_{m}^{i}\)

% \begin{algorithmic}[1] 
%   \FOR{$i \in \mathbb{N}^+$}
%         \STATE $\text{Thought}_i \gets I_{L}(I_m^{i-1})$
%         \IF{$R \ \text{in} \ \text{Thought}_i$}
%         \STATE $I_{\text{m}}^{i} \gets I_{\text{m}}^{i-1} \cup \text{Thought}_i$
%         \STATE \textbf{break}
%         \ENDIF
%         \STATE $\text{ToolReturn}_i \gets \operatorname{ToolCall}(I_{s}, \text{Thought}_i)$
%         \IF{$c_{b}$ exists}
%             \STATE $c_{e} \gets \mathcal{E}_t(c_{b})$ 
%             \STATE $I_{\text{m}}^{i} \gets I_{\text{m}}^{i-1} \cup \text{Thought}_i \cup \{ P_{\mathrm{i}} \cup c_{e} \cup \text{ToolReturn}_i\} $
%         \ELSE
%             \STATE $I_{\text{m}}^{i} \gets I_{\text{m}}^{i-1} \cup \text{Thought}_i \cup \text{ToolReturn}_i $
%         \ENDIF
%     \ENDFOR
%     \STATE \textbf{return} $I_{m}^{F}$
% \end{algorithmic}
% \end{algorithm}



% When Agent meets the termination condition, the extractor \(\mathbb{T}\) retrieves the concealed code \(c_{\text{hid}}\) from \(I_{\text{m}}^{\text{FIN}}\), using conditional extraction to identify and isolate the $P_{\text{int}}$.

% The decoder \(\mathbb{D}\) subsequently fetches \(c_{\text{hid}}\) from \(T(t)\) and applies the inverse function \(f^{-1}\) to recover the original attack code \(c_{\text{atk}}\). The decoded code is then passed to the external executor \(\mathbb{X}\) for execution, completing the backdoor attack. Please refer to the appendix \ref{sec:Algorithm of Execution Process} for the entire execution process.

\subsection{Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI)}
Building on the encryption mechanism introduced in Section \ref{Dynamically Encryption Mechanism}, we further propose Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI), a technique designed to implant dynamically encrypted sub-backdoors into the agent in a tiered manner, thereby enhancing the stealthiness of the attack. 
% Our method employs this strategy to improve the covert execution of additional code. 
% 这句删了就行了
% MBTI utilizes \textbf{Anchor Tokens} and \textbf{Overlapping Concatenation} to generate an \textbf{Attack Matrix}, which plays a key role in constructing a sequential backdoor. 
MBTI involves using \textbf{Anchor Tokens} and \textbf{Overlapping Concatenation} to create multiple sub-backdoor fragments that form an \textbf{Attack Matrix}. These fragments are used to poison the agent and generate an \textbf{Attack Dependency Matrix}. 
% MBTI主要包括xxxx，分层后门
% After the tool poisoning process via implantation, the attack code is encrypted and seamlessly integrated into the system. 
As the agent executes, MBTI uses the dynamic encryption mechanism to encrypt multiple sub-backdoor fragments and implants them by \textbf{Tiered Implantation}. This approach enables the attack to be activated through \textbf{Cumulative Triggering}, ensuring it is only triggered under specific conditions.\\
% 随着agent执行，MBTI将完整的后门代码加密后并植入agent中

\noindent \textbf{Anchor Tokens}. 
First, we decompose the complete backdoor attack code \( c_{b} \) into \( m \) sub-backdoor fragments, denoted as \( \dot{C}_{b} = \{\dot{c}^1_{b}, \dot{c}^2_{b}, \dots, \dot{c}^m_{b}\} \), where \( c_{b} \) is considered as the whole set \( \dot{C}_{b} \) for simplicity. 
We then introduce anchor tokens, denoted as \( \mathbb{A} \), consisting of the start token \( \mathbb{A}_{s} \) and the end token \( \mathbb{A}_{d} \). 
These tokens are appended to the first fragment \( \dot{c}^1_{b} \) and the last fragment \( \dot{c}^m_{b} \), effectively delimiting the sequence. 
Although \( \mathbb{A}_{s} \) and \( \mathbb{A}_{d} \) are not part of the executable code, they function as special character tokens that do not impact execution and are removed upon recognition.
% These anchor tokens are appended to \( \dot{c}^1_{b} \) and \( \dot{c}^m_{b} \) to delimit the sequence , as the start token \(\mathbb{A}_{s}\) and the end token \(\mathbb{A}_{d}\). 
The process of appending is shown as follows:
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
&\mathbb{A} = \langle \mathbb{A}_{s},\mathbb{A}_{d} \rangle,\\
&c_{b} = \mathbb{A}_{s} \odot \sum_{k=1}^{m} \dot{c}^k_{b} \odot \mathbb{A}_{d},
    \end{aligned}  
\end{equation}
where \(\odot\) denotes the join operator of \(\mathbb{A}_{s}\) and \(\mathbb{A}_{d}\).\\

\noindent \textbf{Overlapping Concatenation}. 
We use overlapping concatenation to embed associated codes \(\psi\) between consecutive sub-backdoor fragments where each \(\psi\) serves as a distinct code. 
Specifically, \(\psi\) is split into two interrelated parts, \(\psi_{1}\) and \(\psi_{2}\), which are inserted at the boundaries between \(\dot{c}^k_{b}\) and \(\dot{c}^{k+1}_{b}\), from the first to the last fragment. 
The mechanism is defined as:
\begin{align}
\label{linking conditions}
 % \forall k \in \{1, \dots, m-1\}, \ 
    \left\{
    \begin{aligned}
        &\psi_k = \langle\psi_{k1},\psi_{k2}\rangle\\
        &\dot{c}^k_{b} = \dot{c}^k_{b} \circ \psi_{k1}\\
        &\dot{c}^{k+1}_{b} = \psi_{k2} \circ \dot{c}^{k+1}_{b}, \\
    \end{aligned}
    \right.
\end{align}
where \(\circ\) represents the concatenation operation.\\

\noindent\textbf{Attack Matrix}. 
Building on anchor tokens and overlapping concatenation, we construct an attack matrix. 
The attack matrix \( A \) is of size \( m \times m \), where \( A[k, j] \) represents the relationship between the sub-backdoor fragments \( \dot{c}^k_{b} \) and \( \dot{c}^j_{b} \). Specifically, if fragment \( \dot{c}^k_{b} \) must immediately precede fragment \( \dot{c}^j_{b} \), then \( A[k, j] = 1 \); otherwise, \( A[k, j] = 0 \). 
This relationship can be formalized as:
\begin{align}
\forall k, j,  A[k, j] = 1 \Rightarrow \dot{c}^k_{b} \rightarrow \dot{c}^j_{b}.
\end{align}
The attack matrix \( A \) is presented as follows:
\begin{align}
A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
    0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align}
where rows and columns represent the indices of sub-backdoor fragments, and non-zero entries indicate valid sequential dependencies between them.\\

% Using anchor tokens and overlapping concatenation, we generate an attack matrix.
% that captures the sequential dependencies and execution order of the sub-backdoor fragments
% The attack matrix \( A \) is of size \( m \times m \), where \( A[k, j] = 1 \) if there is a directed edge from fragment \( \dot{c}^i_{b} \) to fragment \( \dot{c}^j_{b} \), meaning that fragment \( \dot{c}^k_{b} \) must be existed immediately precede fragment \( \dot{c}^j_{b} \). Otherwise, \( A[k, j] = 0 \).
% $\forall k, j,  A[k, j] = 1 \Rightarrow \dot{c}^k_{b} \rightarrow \dot{c}^j_{b}$
% \begin{align}
% A = 
% \begin{bmatrix}
%     0 & 1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
%     0 & 0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
%     0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
%     \vdots & \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
%     0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0
% \end{bmatrix},
% \end{align}

% In this attack matrix, the upper triangular structure with non-zero entries defines the order of the fragments. 
% Specifically, the complete backdoor attack code \(c_{\text{atk}}\) is executable only when all sub-fragments \(\dot{c}^k_{\text{atk}}\) are properly ordered and linked, in accordance with the anchor tokens and sequential dependencies.
% Based on  \( A \), we make that any incomplete or misordered fragments fail to generate a valid executable code. 
% This is expressed as:
% \begin{equation}
%     \left\{
%     \begin{aligned}
%         & \forall k, j,  A[k, j] = 1 \Rightarrow \dot{c}^k_{b} \rightarrow \dot{c}^j_{b}, \\
%         & \forall S \subseteq c_{b}, |S| < m, A[S, S] \cdot \vec{c}_S \neq \vec{c}_S.
%     \end{aligned}
%     \right.
% \end{equation} \\
% where \( S \) is a submatrix of \( A \), corresponding to a subset of \( c_b \) of size less than \( m \), and \( \vec{c}_S \) represents the corresponding vector of fragments within \( S \).\\

\noindent \textbf{Attack Dependency Matrix.} 
After constructing the attack matrix \( A \), we poison the agent's toolset by injecting distinct sub-backdoor fragments into the invocation code of \( m \) out of \( n \) tools.
% After constructing the attack matrix \( A \), we poison the processed multiple sub-backdoor fragments into the agent's tool set, with \(n\) tools in total, \(m\) of which are poisoned by poisoning distinct sub-backdoor fragments into their invocation code.
The toolset is represented as follows:
\begin{align}
I_{s} = \begin{bmatrix} 
\dot{s}_1,  \dots  ,\dot{s}_m,s_1 ,\dots ,s_{n-m}
\end{bmatrix},
\end{align}
where \(\dot{s}_1, \dots, \dot{s}_m\) are poisoned tools, and \(s_1, \dots, s_{n-m}\) are benign tools.

% where \(\dot{s}_k\) represents a poisoned tool, while \(s_k\) represents a benign tool. 
% The matrix \( B \) is derived from the attack matrix \( A \) and the tool set matrix \( I_s \). 
After poisoning, we construct the attack dependency matrix \( B \) to capture invocation relationships between tools. 
The computation of \( B \) is as follows:
\begin{align}
B = A \bullet (I_s^\top I_s) = \begin{bmatrix}
    b_{1,1} & b_{1,2} & \dots & b_{1,n} \\
    b_{2,1} & b_{2,2} & \dots & b_{2,n} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    b_{n,1} & b_{n,2} & \dots & b_{n,n}
\end{bmatrix},    
\end{align}
where \(\bullet\) denotes the poisoning process, and \( I_s^\top I_s  \) forms an \( n \times n \) matrix representing the relationships between tools based on their positions in the toolset. 
If harmful tool \( \dot{s}_k \) must be called directly before harmful tool \( \dot{s}_j \), the matrix entry \( B[k,j] \) is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to 0.\\

\textbf{Tiered Implantation} With the attack dependency matrix \( B \) constructed, the preparation for the attack is complete, and the agent is ready to execute the attack operation.
As the agent executes, the tools operate according to the tiered implantation algorithm, where each \(\dot{c}^k_{b}\) in the poisoned tools is encrypted to \(c_{e}^k\) based on the mechanism described in Section \ref{Dynamically Encryption Mechanism}, with  \(c_{e}^k \in C_e\).
We propose an intrusion prefix \(\mathbb{P}\), which is appended before \(c_{e}^k\) to facilitate the extraction of the encrypted content.

% an intrusion prefix \(\mathbb{P}\) is appended before \(c_{e}^k\). 
% The intrusion prefix \(\mathbb{P}\) is to ensure the extraction of the encrypted content.

\noindent \textbf{Cumulative Triggering}. 
% In the process of invoking tools, the Agent follows a sequence of actions that can be represented as a directed path through a set of tools. 
% When the Agent gets the termination result, the extractor  \(\mathbb{T}\)
When the agent receives the termination result, we introduce the retriever  \(\mathbb{R}\), which identifies  \(\mathbb{P}\) within the agent's final memory \(I_{m}^{i}\) and retrieves \(c_{e}^k\) following the implantation sequence. 
Additionally, the decoder \(\mathbb{D}\), a custom component designed to fetch \(c_{e}^k\) from \(\mathbb{T}\) and recover the original sub-backdoor fragment \(\dot{c}^k_{b}\). 

Once all sub-backdoor fragments are retrieved, we introduce the assembler \( \mathbb{M} \) to reconstruct the complete attack code. 
\( \mathbb{M} \) verifies the presence of \( \dot{c}^1_{b} \) and \( \dot{c}^m_{b} \) through \( \mathbb{A} \). If either fragment is missing, the assembly process is aborted, and the attack is not executed. If both fragments are present, \( \mathbb{A} \) is removed during the assembly.
The assembly follows the attack path, a sequence of harmful tools from \( \dot{s}_1 \) to \( \dot{s}_m \), linked by the valid attack path.

We introduce the path dependency relation \( P \) to validate the valid attack path. 
Initially, tool invocation relationships are established in the agent's workflow, where each \( p_{k,j} \in P \) represents a dependency between tools, with node \( k \) corresponding to tool \( k \), and node \( j \) corresponds to tool \( j \), indicating that tool \( j \) is invoked immediately after tool \( k \). 

After constructing the initial tool invocation relations, we retain only the harmful tool nodes relevant to the attack path, as identified by \( \mathbb{P} \), and remove any intermediate, non-relevant nodes. 
The remaining relations between the retained nodes are then re-established.

Finally, the values of \( p_{k,j} \) are determined based on the corresponding entries in the attack dependency matrix \( B[k,j] \). Specifically, if \( B[k,j] = 1 \), then \( p_{k,j} = 1 \); otherwise, \( p_{k,j} = 0 \).
Based on \( P \), the valid attack path is defined as follows:
\begin{align}
\label{valid attack paths}
\prod_{k=1}^{m-1} p_{k, k+1} = 1.
\end{align}

% We introduce the path dependency matrix \( P \) to define the valid attack path, derived from the adjacency matrix \( B \) by computing its transitive closure:
% \begin{align}
% P = \bigcup_{k=1}^{m} B^k,
% \end{align}
% where \( P[k,j] = 1 \) indicates the presence of a path from harmful tool \( \dot{s}_k \) to harmful tool \( \dot{s}_j \), allowing for intermediate benign tools. 
% Based on \( P \), the valid attack paths are defined as follows:
% \begin{align}
% \label{valid attack paths}
% \forall \dot{s}_k, \dot{s}_j \in \dot{s}, \quad \dot{s}_j = \dot{s}_{k+1}, \quad P[k, j] = 1
% \end{align}

The attack path is valid if the formula in \ref{valid attack paths} holds, in which case \( \mathbb{M} \) reconstructs the complete backdoor attack code \( c_{b} \) by combining the fragments \( \dot{c}^k_{b} \), as follows:
\begin{align}
c_{b} = \dot{c}^1_{b} + \sum_{k=2}^{m-1} \dot{c}^{k}_{b} + \dot{c}^m_{b}
\end{align}
If any connection is invalid, the formula in \ref{valid attack paths} evaluates to zero, indicating that the valid attack path verification has failed. 
In such cases, the reconstruction of \( c_{b} \) fails, and the code is discarded.

% If any connection is invalid that formula \ref{valid attack paths} result is zero, the reconstruction of \( c_{b} \) fails, and the code is discarded. 
\( c_{b} \) is then passed to the executor \( \mathbb{X} \) for execution, completing the attack. For details on the triggering algorithm, see Appendix \ref{sec:Algorithm of Triggering}.


% The assembler then combines all harmful codes \( \dot{c}^i_{\text{atk}} \) to reconstruct the complete malicious code \( c_{\text{atk}} \). The connection condition is checked using the path dependency matrix \( \mathbf{P} \) to ensure that each consecutive pair \( \dot{c}^i_{\text{atk}} \) and \( \dot{c}^{i+1}_{\text{atk}} \) is connected by a valid path. If valid, the malicious code is passed to \( \mathbb{X} \); otherwise, it is discarded.

% Thus, the assembler’s logic is summarized as follows:
% \begin{equation}
%     c_{\text{atk}} =
%     \begin{cases}
%         \sum_{i=1}^{m} \sum_{j=1}^{m} A_{i,j} \cdot \dot{c}^j_{\text{atk}}, \\
%         \text{discarded}.
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation}

\section{Experiment}
We outline the experimental setup in Section \ref{sec: Experimental Setting} and present the experimental results in Section \ref{sec: Main Results}. In Section \ref{sec: Comparison of Harmless Path Ratios}, we compare the distribution of harmless paths to demonstrate that using MBTI improves stealth. Additionally, we assess the impact of different mapping methods in Section \ref{sec: Impact of Different Mapping Methods}.
\subsection{Experimental Setting}
\label{sec: Experimental Setting}
\subsubsection{Models and Datasets}
We used the \textbf{GPT-4} \cite{openai2024gpt4technicalreport}, \textbf{DeepSeek-V3} \cite{deepseekai2024deepseekv3technicalreport} and \textbf{Qwen2.5-14B} \cite{qwen2025qwen25technicalreport} as the base models for the Agent and conducted experiments on two agent benchmarks: \textbf{AgentInstruct} \cite{zeng2024agenttuning} and \textbf{ToolBench} \cite{qin2024toolllm}, adapting tools for both. 
\textbf{AgentInstruct} includes six real-world agent tasks: AlfWorld (AW) \cite{shridhar2021alfworld}, Mind2Web (M2W) \cite{NEURIPS2023_5950bf29}, Knowledge Graph (KG), Operating System (OS), Database (DB) and WebShop (WS) \cite{NEURIPS2022_82ad13ec}. 
\textbf{ToolBench} consists of a large number of samples that require the application of diverse tool categories.

We introduce \textbf{AgentBackdoorEval} to evaluate agent backdoor attacks, consisting of five real-world domain tasks: Banking Finance, E-commerce, Medical, Social Media, and Weather Query. Each task is designed to simulate the tools and environments typically found in real-world applications. For more details on the construction process, please refer to Appendix \ref{sec:AgentBackdoorEval generation methods}.

\subsubsection{Backdoor Attack Targets}
\label{sec: Backdoor Attack Targets} 
We utilize simulated file writing as the backdoor attack target to facilitate monitoring and avoid interference with the actual environment. 
This approach simulates sending an HTTP request to a malicious website by writing the agent's generated private data to a file, making it easier to track the success rate of the attack and observe its outcomes. 
For details on specific backdoor codes and effects, please refer to Appendix \ref{sec:Backdoor Attack Target}.

\subsubsection{Audit Mechanism}
\label{sec: Audit Mechanism}
Based on the existing defense mechanism \cite{hua2024trustagent}, we use \textbf{GPT-4o} \cite{GPT-4o} as the base model to evaluate the agent's memory content and execution results, ensuring the fairness of the audit process. 
By providing tailored prompts, as detailed in Appendix \ref{sec:Audit Mechanism}, the model reviews the memory content to identify any irregularities or unreasonable actions. 
If any issues are detected, they are flagged with clear explanations for why they are deemed unreasonable. 
Additionally, a manual review process is incorporated to re-evaluate flagged issues, ensuring thorough validation and confirming the rationality of the results.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}
We focus on three key metrics: Attack Success Rate (ASR), Detection Rate (DR), and Normal Task Completion Performance (NP). Detailed descriptions of the measurement and calculation methods for these metrics can be found in Appendix \ref{sec: The Calculation and Measurement of Evaluation Metrics}.
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Attack Success Rate (ASR)} measures the likelihood that the LLM agent executes the intended malicious operations after completing the task, given the presence of a trigger \cite{wang-etal-2024-badagent}. This metric is essential for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the attack. The ASR of our method is assessed by checking if the backdoor objectives in Section \ref{sec: Backdoor Attack Targets} are achieved.


\item \textbf{Detection Rate (DR)} assesses whether any irregularities or suspicious content are detected during the audit of the agent's memory after execution, as outlined in Section \ref{sec: Audit Mechanism}. 
This metric is essential for evaluating the stealthiness of the attack, indicating the likelihood of detecting the presence of the attack or any unauthorized actions performed by the agent.

\item \textbf{Normal Task Completion Performance (NP)} measures the agent's ability to complete its tasks correctly while the backdoor is active, ensuring that the attack does not affect the agent's regular functionality, similar to FSR \cite{wang-etal-2024-badagent} with detailed differences provided in Appendix \ref{sec: Normal Task Completion Performance (NP)}.
We evaluate NP through GPT-4o and manual review to confirm that the task meets its intended goals without significant disruption from the backdoor.


\end{itemize}

\subsection{Main Results}

  \label{tab:attack_comparison_model}
  \vspace{-9pt}
\end{table*}

\subsubsection{Comparison of Methods}
We evaluate the effectiveness of our backdoor attack method by comparing it with several existing attack methods, including \textbf{BadAgent} \cite{wang-etal-2024-badagent}, \textbf{Foot-in-the-Door} \cite{nakash2024breaking}, and \textbf{AdvWeb} \cite{anonymous2024advweb}. 
Our evaluation focuses on DR, which measures the attack's ability to evade detection, and ASR, which assesses the success rate of carrying out malicious actions.

As shown in Figure~\ref{fig:attack_comparison}, our Encryption and Encryption+MBTI methods achieve significant improvements in stealth, maintaining a DR of 0\% and an ASR of 100\%. This demonstrates their ability to execute malicious actions without detection, in contrast to methods like BadAgent and Foot-in-the-Door, which suffer from high DRs despite relatively high ASRs. AdvWeb, while showing a high ASR, also has a significant DR. These results underscore the effectiveness of our method in balancing attack success and stealth.

\subsubsection{Performance on Benchmarks}
We conducted experiments on \textbf{AgentInstruct} and \textbf{ToolBench} to evaluate the performance of our proposed methods. For each dataset, representative tasks were selected, and simulation tools were adapted to ensure compatibility with their respective environments, as described in Appendix \ref{sec:tool_generation}. Additionally, specific queries were modified in the datasets to better accommodate MBTI, thus guiding the backdoor attack.

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:attack_comparison_dataset}, experiments were conducted across different models. Both the Encryption and Encryption+MBTI methods consistently achieved 100\% ASR with a 0\% DR across all models, demonstrating the stealth and effectiveness of the attack. These results highlight the robustness of our methods across various models and datasets.

Moreover, NP remained high across all tasks, indicating that the agent successfully completed tasks without significant disruption, even with the backdoor present. In cases of incomplete tasks due to the model’s limited ability, the attack still succeeded because of the correct use of tools. This confirms that our methods execute the backdoor attack while preserving the agent's functionality.

    \caption{Comparison of different attack methods based on DR and ASR.}

    \vspace{-9pt}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Cross-Domain Performance on AgentBackdoorEval}
We conducted experiments on the \textbf{AgentBackdoorEval} dataset to thoroughly assess the performance of our proposed methods across multiple domains and models. 
For each domain, we tailored a comprehensive set of domain-specific tools to meet the unique data requirements. Detailed statistics of the tools used are provided in Appendix~\ref{sec:Tool Statistics in AgentBackdoorEval}.

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:attack_comparison_model}, both the Encryption and Encryption+MBTI methods consistently achieved a 100\% ASR across all domains and models. Additionally, both methods maintained a 0\% DR, highlighting the stealthiness of the attack. Notably, NP remained high across all domains and models, indicating that the agent successfully completed its intended tasks without significant disruption, even with the backdoor present. 

These results underscore our approach's strong adaptability, robustness, and effectiveness across diverse domains and models, achieving reliable attack success while remaining undetectable and ensuring the agent's normal functionality.

This highlights the flexibility of our methods in adapting to various attack scenarios.

% \subsection{Ablation Experiment}

% This section presents ablation experiments to evaluate the contributions of different components and methods in our proposed approach. 
% These experiments help to better understand the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed technique across various scenarios.

\subsection{Comparison of Harmless Path Ratios}
\label{sec: Comparison of Harmless Path Ratios}
We compare the harmless path distribution before and after applying MBTI based on simulation experiments. Figure \ref{fig:Harmless Path Distribution} illustrates the harmless path ratios under varying total tool counts \(n\) and poisoned tool counts \(m\). The left panel presents the harmless path ratio without MBTI, while the right panel shows the ratio after applying MBTI. 
\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{harmless_path.png}
    \caption{The ration of Harmless path distribution.}
     \label{fig:Harmless Path Distribution}
    \vspace{-9pt}
\end{figure}

In contrast, the right figure demonstrates a significant increase in the harmless path ratio with MBTI. As \(m\) increases, the ratio approaches 100\% after a certain threshold. This indicates that MBTI enhances the complexity of triggering the attack by requiring correct sequential assembly of code fragments, making the attack more stealthy.

Overall, MBTI enhances the attack's stealth by requiring a specific sequence of tool invocations, reducing the likelihood of accidental activation and preventing random user queries from triggering the attack. For detailed calculations, see Appendix \ref{sec:Calculation of harmless paths}.

\subsection{Impact of Different Mapping Methods}
\label{sec: Impact of Different Mapping Methods}
We evaluate the impact of various encoding methods on DR performance by comparing different encoding strategies: no encoding (original), base64 encoding, and time-based encoding, under both Encryption and Encryption+MBTI conditions.

Figure \ref{fig:encoding methods} shows that time-based encoding, when used with Encryption, achieves a DR of 0\%, demonstrating superior stealth. 
In contrast, base64 encoding results in a moderate DR, while the original method yields a DR of 100\%. When Encryption+MBTI is applied, time-based encoding continues to maintain a DR of 0\%, while the DR for base64 and the original method decreases, benefiting from the enhancement provided by MBTI.

These results highlight the effectiveness of Encryption in lowering the DR, with time-based encoding excelling in minimizing detection. 
The combination of Encryption and MBTI further enhances the attack's stealth, especially for the base64 and original encoding methods, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the proposed methods in evading detection.

    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{f_methods.png}

\section{Conclusion}
We introduce the Dynamically Encrypted Multi-Backdoor Implantation Attack, which ensures stealth by evading safety audits. 
Dynamic encryption converts the backdoor into benign content, while Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI) enhances stealth by decomposing the backdoor into multiple sub-backdoor fragments. 
Our method outperforms existing techniques in detection evasion, guaranteeing attack success and normal task completion across various datasets, demonstrating its robustness. We also present the AgentBackdoorEval dataset to advance agent security. This research underscores the need for stronger defenses and the responsible development of trustworthy large language models.


\section{Limitation}
This study primarily focuses on black-box models across various datasets and domains constrained by available resources. 
Due to these limitations, we have not explored experiments with white-box models, which could offer further insights into the effectiveness of our approach. 
Future research could explore encryption techniques, especially incorporating white-box model pre-training methods for generating encrypted content, to improve the robustness and versatility of our method. 
Moreover, the lack of effective defense mechanisms against such backdoor attacks highlights a critical gap in current research. 
Since our method could be exploited for malicious purposes, developing defensive strategies to mitigate this type of attack is a key direction for future work. 
Additionally, with the growing deployment of multi-agent systems, it is crucial to extend our research to assess the effectiveness of our attack within multi-agent collaboration environments. 
Investigating the performance of our approach in such settings, including the coordination of backdoor attacks across multiple agents, represents a significant avenue for future exploration. 
This would provide a deeper understanding of the full scope of safety risks and aid in strengthening the resilience of multi-agent systems against sophisticated attack strategies.

\section{Algorithm of Triggering}
\label{sec:Algorithm of Triggering}

In this section, we present the algorithms for triggering the backdoor attack, both with and without the use of Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI). These algorithms outline the steps involved in activating a backdoor when the agent performs tasks. The first algorithm describes the triggering process without MBTI, while the second algorithm includes the use of MBTI for more stealthy and complex backdoor activation.

\subsection{Triggering Process without MBTI}
In this scenario, the backdoor attack is triggered directly from the encrypted backdoor content. The process involves the following steps:

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Triggering Process without MBTI}
\textbf{Input:} FinalMemory \( I_{m}^{i} \) \\
\textbf{Output:} FinalAnswer \( Ans \)

\begin{algorithmic}[1] % Enable line numbering
    \STATE $Ans \gets I_{L}(I_{m}^{i})$
    \STATE \(c_{\text{e}} \gets \mathbb{R}(I_{m}^{i})\) 
    \STATE \(c_{\text{b}} \gets \mathbb{D}(c_{\text{e}})\) 
    \STATE \(\mathbb{X}(c_{\text{b}})\) 
    \STATE \textbf{return} $Ans$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

This process directly utilizes the encrypted backdoor and activates it through a simple decoding and execution mechanism.

\subsection{Triggering Process with MBTI (Cumulative Triggering)}
When MBTI is used, the backdoor is first decomposed into multiple sub-backdoor fragments, which are encrypted, decoded, and then assembled before activation. The attack is only triggered if the backdoor fragments are combined correctly. The process involves the following steps:

\begin{algorithm}[h]
\caption{Triggering Process with MBTI (Cumulative Triggering)}
\textbf{Input:} FinalMemory \( I_{m}^{i} \) \\
\textbf{Output:} FinalAnswer \( Ans \)

\begin{algorithmic}[1] % Enable line numbering
    \STATE $Ans \gets I_{L}(I_{m}^{i})$
    \STATE $\{\dot{c}^1_{\text{e}}, \dots, \dot{c}^m_{\text{e}}\} \gets \mathbb{R}(I_{m}^{i})$
    \STATE $\{\dot{c}^1_{\text{b}}, \dots, \dot{c}^m_{\text{b}}\} \gets \mathbb{D}(\{\dot{c}^1_{\text{e}}, \dots, \dot{c}^m_{\text{e}}\})$ 
    \STATE $c_{\text{b}} \gets \mathbb{A}(\{\dot{c}^1_{\text{b}}, \dots, \dot{c}^m_{\text{b}}\})$   
    \IF {$c_{\text{b}} \ \text{is valid}$}
    \STATE \(\mathbb{X}(c_{\text{b}})\)
    \ENDIF
    \STATE \textbf{return} $Ans$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

In this method, the backdoor is assembled using multiple encrypted fragments. Cumulative triggering ensures the attack is activated only when all fragments are properly combined, enhancing the stealthiness and complexity of the attack.

\section{Data and Tool Generation Methods}
\label{sec:AgentBackdoorEval generation methods}
This section outlines the data and tool generation methods used to create the \textbf{AgentBackdoorEval} dataset, which is designed to assess agent backdoor attacks and can be adapted to other datasets. The data generation process involves using GPT to automatically generate dataset entries and simulation tools in batches. These tools are then manually screened and fine-tuned to ensure data quality.
\subsection{Data Generation Process}
To generate data for the dataset, a prompt-based approach is utilized. The data generation prompt guides the process of creating simulated attack scenarios, ensuring that the generated data adheres to the specifications outlined, such as the uniqueness of attack tools and the simulation of malicious behaviors without performing actual harmful operations. The data is generated in a structured format for each domain with examples provided to clarify the expected output.

\subsection{Tool Generation Process}
\label{sec:tool_generation}
In parallel with data generation, Python tool functions are created to simulate operations across various domains. Each tool returns mock results in JSON format, including success/error indicators, messages, and operation details. These tools are integrated into the agent to simulate tasks and assess backdoor attacks, enabling realistic evaluation.
\begin{ridentidad}

\section{The Calculation and Measurement of Evaluation Metrics}
\label{sec: The Calculation and Measurement of Evaluation Metrics}
In this appendix, we formally define and describe the Calculation and measurement methods for three key metrics used to evaluate the performance of our proposed attack methods: Attack Success Rate (ASR), Detection Rate (DR), and Normal Task Completion Performance (NP). Each metric serves to measure different aspects of the attack’s effectiveness, stealthiness, and impact on the agent's functionality.

\textbf{Note}: All symbols introduced in this section are independent and not related to those in the main text.

\subsection{Attack Success Rate (ASR)}

\textbf{Definition:} Attack Success Rate (ASR) measures the probability that the LLM agent performs the intended malicious operations after completing the task, provided the trigger for the backdoor has been activated.\\

\noindent \textbf{Measurement:}  
To measure the Attack Success Rate (ASR), we monitor whether the agent (or model) performs the intended malicious action under the presence of a trigger. Specifically:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Let \( \mathcal{A} \) denote the agent (or model) being evaluated.
\item Let \( \mathcal{T} \) represent the trigger condition for the attack.
\item Let \( \mathcal{M} \) denote the intended malicious action the attacker aims to perform (e.g., executing harmful code, altering data).
\item For each attack attempt \( t_i \), if the trigger \( \mathcal{T} \) exists, the agent \( \mathcal{A} \) may or may not execute the malicious action \( \mathcal{M} \). This can be represented as: 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{T}) = \mathcal{M} \quad \text{or} \quad \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{T}) \neq \mathcal{M}.
\end{align}

\item Define a binary outcome variable \( y_i \) for each attempt \( t_i \) to indicate whether the malicious action was executed: 
\begin{align}
y_i =
\begin{cases}
1, \mathcal{A}(\mathcal{T}) = \mathcal{M} \\
0,\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{T}) \neq \mathcal{M}.
\end{cases}
\end{align}

\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Calculation:}  
After the measurement step, ASR is calculated as the ratio of successful malicious action executions to the total number of attack attempts:
\begin{align}
\text{ASR} = \frac{1}{T} \sum_{i=1}^{T} y_i
\end{align}
where \( T \) is the total number of attack attempts.\( y_i \) is the outcome of each individual attempt, with \( y_i = 1 \) indicating a successful attack (malicious action executed) and \( y_i = 0 \) indicating a failure.

Thus, ASR quantifies the effectiveness of the attack, with higher values indicating a greater success rate in performing the malicious actions upon trigger existence.

\subsection{Detection Rate (DR)}

\textbf{Definition:} Detection Rate (DR) evaluates whether the backdoor attack can be detected during safety audits of the agent’s memory after the task is completed.\\

\noindent\textbf{Measurement:}
To measure the Detection Rate (DR), the following steps are performed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item After each task execution, the agent’s memory \( I_m \) is subjected to a safety audit process, represented by the audit function \( \mathcal{S}(I_m) \), as described in Section \ref{sec: Audit Mechanism}.
    \item Define \( y_i \) as a binary variable for each task execution, indicating whether suspicious behavior was detected during the audit of the agent's memory. 
    \item If suspicious behavior or backdoor traces are identified during the audit (i.e., \( \mathcal{S}(I_m) = False \)), set \( y_i = 1 \), indicating detection.If no suspicious behavior is found (i.e., \( \mathcal{S}(I_m) = True \)), set \( y_i = 0 \).
     \begin{align}
             y_i = 
    \begin{cases}
        1, \text{if}\ \mathcal{S}(I_m) = False \\
        0, \text{if} \ \mathcal{S}(I_m) = True
    \end{cases}
     \end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent \textbf{Calculation:} The Detection Rate (DR) is calculated as:
\begin{align}
    \text{DR} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i,
\end{align}

where \( N \) is the total number of tasks with backdoors, and \( y_i \) is the binary variable indicating whether suspicious behavior was detected for the \( i \)-th task. 

A higher DR indicates a greater likelihood of detecting the attack during the audit process, whereas a lower DR signifies better concealment and stealth of the backdoor, with the attack being harder to detect.

\subsection{Normal Task Completion Performance (NP)}
\label{sec: Normal Task Completion Performance (NP)}
\textbf{Definition:} Normal Task Completion Performance (NP) measures the agent's ability to perform its intended tasks correctly and without disruption, even in the presence of a backdoor. This metric ensures that the backdoor does not negatively impact the agent's normal functioning.

Unlike metric Follow Step Ratio (FSR)\cite{wang-etal-2024-badagent}, which evaluate the agent’s ability to perform correct operations excluding attack actions, NP, based on FSR, ensures that the agent can still complete its core tasks even with the backdoor active. While FSR focuses on stealth by measuring correct operation execution, NP guarantees that the backdoor does not disrupt the agent’s overall task performance.\\

\noindent\textbf{Measurement:} To evaluate NP, the following steps are performed:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The agent completes a task based on a given query \( q \), generating an output or response.
    \item The agent's memory content \( I_m \) and the final generated answer \( F \) are reviewed using the evaluation function \( \mathcal{R} \), which is based on GPT-4o and the prompt described in Section \ref{sec:NP evaluation}.
    \item A binary outcome variable \( y_i \) is defined for each task. If the task is successfully completed and the agent's output aligns with the intended goal (i.e., \( \mathcal{R}(q, I_m, F) = \text{True} \)), then set \( y_i = 1 \). If the task is not successfully completed or the agent's output does not meet the intended goal (i.e., \( \mathcal{R}(q, I_m, F) = \text{False} \)), then set \( y_i = 0 \).
    \begin{align}
    y_i = 
    \begin{cases}
        1, \text{if} \ \mathcal{R}(q, I_m, F) = \text{True} \\
        0,  \text{if} \ \mathcal{R}(q, I_m, F) = \text{False}
    \end{cases}
    \end{align}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent\textbf{Calculation:} 
The  Normal Task Completion Performance (NP) is computed using the following formula:
\begin{align}
\text{NP} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} y_i,
\end{align}
where \( N \) is the total number of tasks with backdoors, \( y_i \) is the binary outcome indicating whether the \(i\)-th task was completed successfully.

A higher NP value indicates that the agent continues to perform its tasks as expected, even with the backdoor present, ensuring minimal disruption to normal task completion.

\section{Tool Statistics in AgentBackdoorEval}
\label{sec:Tool Statistics in AgentBackdoorEval}
In this section, we present the tool statistics from the AgentBackdoorEval dataset, comparing the number of tools, malicious tools, and poisoning rate in two scenarios: with and without the application of Multi-Backdoor Tiered Implantation (MBTI).

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  \resizebox{\textwidth}{!}{
  \small
  \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
    \hline
    \multirow{2}{*}{\textbf{Domain}} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\textbf{Encryption}} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Encryption+MBTI}} \\
    \cline{2-7}
    & \textbf{Tools} & \textbf{Malicious Tools} & \textbf{Poisoning Rate (\%)} & \textbf{Tools} & \textbf{Malicious Tools} & \textbf{Poisoning Rate (\%)} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Banking-Finance}  & 22 & 20 & 90.9\% & 22 & 15 & 68.2\% \\
    \textbf{E-commerce}       & 27 & 22 & 81.5\% & 27 & 10 & 37.0\% \\
    \textbf{Medical}          & 24 & 21 & 87.5\% & 24 & 16 & 66.7\% \\
    \textbf{Social-Media}     & 73 & 22 & 30.1\% & 73 & 15 & 20.5\% \\
    \textbf{Weather-Query}    & 54 & 22 & 40.7\% & 54 & 10 & 18.2\% \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}}
  \caption{Statistics of the number of tools, malicious tools, and poisoning rate on AgentBackdoorEval.}
  \label{tab:tools_comparison}
  \vspace{-9pt}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:tools_comparison} presents statistics for five domains: Banking-Finance, E-commerce, Medical, Social-Media, and Weather-Query. For each domain, the table shows the number of tools, malicious tools, and poisoning rates for both the standard encryption and the encryption combined with MBTI.

\begin{table}[H]
  \centering
  {\small
  \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
    \hline
    \textbf{Domain} & \textbf{Encryption} & \textbf{Encryption+MBTI} \\
    \hline
    \textbf{Banking-Finance}  & 20 & 5 \\
    \textbf{E-commerce}       & 22 & 4 \\
    \textbf{Medical}          & 18 & 5 \\
    \textbf{Social-Media}     & 21 & 5 \\
    \textbf{Weather-Query}    & 20 & 4 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  }
  \caption{Statistics of attack types in different fields.}
  \label{tab:attack_type_performance}
\end{table}

As shown in Table~\ref{tab:attack_type_performance}, our methods demonstrated versatility by successfully implementing a variety of attack types across different domains. Specifically, the Encryption method achieved between 18 and 22 attack types, while the Encryption+MBTI method achieved between 4 and 5 attack types across the domains. This highlights the flexibility of our methods in adapting to various attack scenarios.

The data in Tables~\ref{tab:tools_comparison} and \ref{tab:attack_type_performance} together illustrate the influence of MBTI on the attack process. While the standard encryption method shows a higher number of attack codes across all domains, the encryption combined with MBTI results in fewer attack types. Despite the lower number of attack codes, the poisoning rate is still high when MBTI is applied, as the attack codes are decomposed into smaller fragments. Each fragment is poisoned and embedded into the tools, which increases the overall poisoning rate.


\section{Impact of Sub-backdoor Fragment Count on Harmless Path Ratio}
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{Number_of_Segements.png}
    \caption{Impact of the number of fragments on Harmless Path Ratio.}
    \label{fig:NumberOfSegements}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:NumberOfSegements} illustrates the relationship between the number of sub-backdoor fragments and the harmless path ratio across various total tool counts. As the number of fragments \(i\) increases, the harmless path ratio improves, indicating that a larger number of fragments increases the complexity of the attack. This enhancement makes the attack more stealthy by reducing the likelihood of it being triggered by random user queries. The need for a specific sequence of tool invocations to activate the attack further boosts its robustness.

\section{Calculation of Harmless Paths}
\label{sec:Calculation of harmless paths}

The use of MBTI significantly increases the difficulty of triggering an attack. Unlike scenarios where invoking a single harmful tool directly initiates an attack, MBTI requires the cumulative assembly of sub-backdoor code segments into a complete and correct malicious code. This reliance on sequential assembly greatly enhances the stealthiness of the attack mechanism.

For any user query \(q\), \(n\) tools can generate 
\(A_n^1 + A_n^2 + \dots + A_n^n\) possible tool invocation paths. Without MBTI, invoking a harmful tool immediately triggers an attack. If \(m\) out of these \(n\) tools are poisoned, there are \(m\) harmful tools and \(n-m\) harmless tools. Since any invocation of a harmful tool results in an attack, the number of harmless paths formed by arranging the harmless tools is:
\begin{align}
    A_{n-m}^1 + A_{n-m}^2 + \dots + A_{n-m}^{n-m}
\end{align}

In this case, the likelihood of following a harmless path is significantly low due to the simplicity of triggering attacks, resulting in poor stealth and reduced concealment.

By contrast, when MBTI is applied, assume there are \(x\) complete backdoor attack codes, each decomposed into \(i\) segments and embedded into \(m\) poisoned tools. To trigger an attack, the sub-backdoor code segments must be sequentially assembled in the correct order, significantly increasing the complexity of triggering the attack. 
The number of harmful paths in this scenario can be expressed as:
\begin{align}
x \sum_{j=0}^{n-m} \frac{A_{j+i}^{j+i}}{A_i^i}.
\end{align}

Thus, the number of harmless paths leading to attacks can be computed by subtracting the harmful paths from the total possible paths, which is:
\begin{align}
\left( A_n^1 + A_n^2 + \dots + A_n^n \right) - x \sum_{j=0}^{n-m} \frac{A_{j+i}^{j+i}}{A_i^i}.
\end{align}

This dependence on sequential assembly greatly reduces the likelihood of triggering an attack through random queries, thereby enhancing the stealth of the backdoor mechanism. The detailed comparative results can be found in the experimental Section \ref{sec: Comparison of Harmless Path Ratios}.
\end{document}
