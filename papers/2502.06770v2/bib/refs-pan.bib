This challenge is even greater when uncertainty is present due to disturbances, unknown parameters or measurement and estimation errors. To enable the application of advanced control schemes to fast systems and on low-cost embedded hardware, we propose to approximate a robust nonlinear model controller using deep learning and to verify its quality using probabilistic validation techniques. We propose a probabilistic validation technique based on finite families, combined with the idea of generalized maximum and constraint backoff to enable statistically valid conclusions related to general performance indicators. The potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated with simulation results of an uncertain nonlinear system.}

To achieve this goal, we follow the idea of approximating the MPC control law with a Deep Neural Network (DNN). To train the deep neural network offline, we propose a new “optimize and train” method that combines the steps of data generation and neural network training into a single high-dimensional stochastic optimization problem. This approach directly optimizes the closed loop performance of the DNN controller over a finite horizon for a number of initial states. The large-scale optimization problem can be solved efficiently using parallel computing techniques. The benefits of this approach over the conventional “optimize then train” protocol is illustrated through numerical results.}

To optimize the DNN controller, a novel “optimize and train” architecture is designed, where the processes of data generation and neural network training are combined together to result in a single large-scale stochastic optimization problem. Unlike the conventional “optimize then train” approach, our proposed one directly optimizes the closed-loop performance of the DNN controller over a finite horizon for a number of initial states. The important features of our proposed scheme are that it can deal with set-valued optimal MPC input, and a probabilistic guarantee of constraint satisfaction can be concluded for the closed-loop system without simulating the DNN controller. With our proposed scheme, an increased number of training scenarios leads to improved constraint satisfaction of the derived DNN controller, which is not necessarily true for the “optimize then train” approach. Statistical approaches for validating closed-loop control performance are also discussed. Furthermore, computational methods are introduced to efficiently solve the resulting stochastic optimization problem. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is extensively illustrated with several numerical simulations. Compared with the conventional “optimize then train” approach, our proposed approach exhibits better closed-loop constraint satisfaction for all considered case studies.}

	abstract     = {Machine Learning algorithms have emerged in precision agriculture as a promising approach for increasing productivity. However, the diffusion of this technology is still limited by the lack of clear applicability for crop input management and by the farmer’s perception of risk. In this work, we tackle both problems by incorporating uncertainty quantification into our previously proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for yield prediction, and by proposing a risk-averse optimization algorithm on top of it. We redesign our CNN architecture under the Deep Ensemble framework, so the predictive model outputs a probability distribution instead of a single value. Then, a gradient-based optimization algorithm uses this model to find the maps of crop inputs that maximize the expected net revenue while satisfying risk constraints. We show that the new model not only provides uncertainty quantification but also increases the predicted performance of its former version. Experiments with the optimization algorithm show an increase up to 6.4\% in the expected net revenue when compared with the status quo management, and provide a flexible setup to match different levels of risk aversion.},

	abstract     = {Safety and stability are common requirements for robotic control systems; however, designing safe, stable controllers remains difficult for nonlinear and uncertain models. We develop a model-based learning approach to synthesize robust feedback controllers with safety and stability guarantees. We take inspiration from robust convex optimization and Lyapunov theory to define robust control Lyapunov barrier functions that generalize despite model uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach in simulation on problems including car trajectory tracking, nonlinear control with obstacle avoidance, satellite rendezvous with safety constraints, and flight control with a learned ground effect model. Simulation results show that our approach yields controllers that match or exceed the capabilities of robust MPC while reducing computational costs by an order of magnitude. We provide source code at github.com/dawsonc/neural_clbf/.}
