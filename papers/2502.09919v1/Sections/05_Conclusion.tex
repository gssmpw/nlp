\section{Conclusion}
In this study, we proposed AttenGluco, a multimodal Transformer-based framework for long-term blood glucose forecasting using CGM and activity data. By integrating cross-attention and multi-scale attention, our model effectively fuses heterogeneous time-series data and captures long-term dependencies. Our evaluation on the AI-READI dataset demonstrated that AttenGluco outperforms baseline models under different test and train scenarios across various subject cohorts. AttenGluco improved RMSE by about 10\% in the isolated subject training scenario. In the cohort-wise fine-tuning scenario, RMSE improvements are even more pronounced, with reductions of about 12\%. Additionally, AttenGluco achieved higher correlation scores across all groups, further validating its enhanced predictive capability. Our analysis of forecasting accuracy at different prediction horizons (5, 30, and 60 minutes) shows that AttenGluco consistently outperformed the baseline model, with the most notable gains observed at longer horizons, where it reduced RMSE by up to 3.18 compared to the baseline. Furthermore, our forgetting analysis revealed that AttenGluco maintains lower error rates when fine-tuned on new cohorts. By improving long-term blood glucose forecasting, AttenGluco has the potential to advance precision medicine for diabetes care, enabling more proactive and individualized interventions to maintain optimal glucose levels.
