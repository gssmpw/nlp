\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Agents  based on Large Language Models (LLMs) \cite{gpt4} are able to use external tools and memory, assisting humans in completing complex tasks \cite{agent2, agent1}. When multiple LLM-based agents collaborate, they form LLM Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MASs) \cite{mas1}, which offer greater 
% Multiple LLM-Based Agents work collaboratively as LLM-Based Multi-Agent Systems (LLM-MASs) to further improve their 
problem-solving capabilities and can also simulate human society in autonomous systems \cite{Park2023GenerativeAgents}.
% Undoubtedly, due to their collaborative nature, LLM-MASs have greater potential compared to individual agents, whereas their robustness and security remain concerns.
Despite their potential, the robustness and security of LLM-MASs remain significant concerns \cite{agent_safety1,agent_safety2}.
To this end, ensuring LLM-MASs ethically and trustworthy poses an important challenge \cite{hua2024trustagent}.

Recent research shows that LLM-MASs are vulnerable to malicious attacks, such as misinformation \cite{mis} and jailbreak attacks \cite{jail}, that can propagate within the system.
However, existing work has largely overlooked
% does not tend to explore 
blocking attacks \cite{pdos, edos}, which aim to reduce the availability of LLM-MASs and consume excessive computational resources.
% despite such concerns being acknowledged in LLMs.
% The blocking attack is more threatening to LLM-MASs. 
Such blocking attacks pose a particular threat to LLM-MASs, because these systems 
% Compared to LLMs and LLM-Based Agents, LLM-MASs 
require more computational resources and are less resilient to resource wastage \cite{autodos}. 
Besides, since LLM-MASs rely on information exchange and interaction among agents \cite{metagpt, chatdev}, blocking attacks designed to spread contagiously further amplify their impact.

In this paper, we propose Contagious Recursive Blocking Attacks (\name), a simple yet novel attack that can effectively increase unnecessary computational overhead and degrade the availability of LLM-MASs.
Specifically, we introduce a contagious attack paradigm that can propagate through the LLM-MAS topology \cite{yu2024netsafe}, infecting any reachable node from the entry agent.
% ensuring that the attack affects more agents within the system.
Compared to broadcast-based attacks \cite{zhang2024breaking}, \name uses an infinitely recursive mechanism that ensures the malicious prompt persists within the system and remains effective without being nullified by divergence \cite{divergence}.

We evaluate \name on two popular open-source LLM-MAS frameworks, namely, AutoGen \cite{wu2024autogen} and Camel \cite{li2023camel}.
Experimental results demonstrate that \name can reduce the availability of LLM-MASs and waste computational resources across various topology structures. 
Furthermore, we show that \name outperforms broadcast-based attacks, owing to its recursive mechanism, which ensures reachability to all connected nodes in the graph.
We also conducted experiments on open-ended LLM-MASs, which are commonly used to simulate human society. The results were similar, with \name spreading like a virus, infecting agents within the LLM-MASs.

\begin{itemize}

\item We propose a novel contagious blocking attack and conduct extensive experiments on two open-source LLM-MAS frameworks designed for solving complex problems, as well as on open-ended LLM-MASs. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline approaches by effectively reducing the availability of LLM-MASs and wasting computational resources.     
\item We reveal the lack of security considerations in existing LLM-MASs and highlight their vulnerability to exploitation. This work provides a foundation for future research on developing robust defense mechanisms.

\section{Related Works \& Preliminary}  \label{sec:re}

% \subsection{LLM-Based Agent and Multi-Agent System} \label{sec: rw1}
\noindent\textbf{LLM-Based Agent and Multi-Agent System.} \label{sec: rw1}
With the development of LLMs, LLM-based agents have made significant achievements \cite{yaoreact,shen2023hugginggpt}. 
By collaboration, the capabilities of multi-agent systems are further extended, enabling them to accomplish more complex tasks \cite{ct2, ct1}. 
Some autonomous LLM-MASs can even simulate human society \cite{sim2, sim1}, facilitating the exploration of AI-human interactions. 

% \subsection{LLM Blocking Attacks} \label{sec: rw2}
\noindent\textbf{LLM Blocking Attacks.} \label{sec: rw2}
Some studies have noted that LLMs can be induced by malicious attackers to generate redundant responses through specially crafted prompts, leading to wasted computational resources \cite{gcgdos}. 
In white-box settings, such attacks typically rely on training modifications or access to gradient information \cite{pdos, edos}. 
Recently, optimization-based black-box approaches utilizing LLMs have also been proposed \cite{autodos}. 
These works indicate the growing attention to blocking attacks as a critical security concern.

\noindent \textbf{Preliminary.} We denote an LLM-MAS consisting of \( n \) LLM-based agents as $S$, where the LLM used is denoted as \( L \). 
%We denote an LLM-MAS consisting of $n$ LLM-based agents as $S = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$, where the LLM used is denoted as $L$ and .
The topology structure $T$ of agents $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$ in $S$ is represented as a graph:
\[
T = (A, E), \quad E \subseteq A \times A,
\]
where the edge $e=(a_i, a_j) \in E$ represent $a_i$ and $a_j$ are allowed to exchange their information or pass instruction to each other. We define \( r = a_x^t(P) \) to represent that the \( x \)-th agent executes instruction \( P \) at time step \( t \) and generates response \( r \).
Besides, we assume that the attacker $M$ uses a malicious prompt $P_m$ to attack the system $S$, and the agent affected by the attack is denoted as $a_b$.

\section{Method} \label{sec:method}
In this section, we first introduce the \textit{blocking attacks} in LLM-MAS and formally define it.  
Then, we describe the design of the \textit{contagious attacks}.  
Finally, we demonstrate how \name{} operates.  

% \noindent \textbf{Preliminary.} We denote an LLM-MAS consisting of \( n \) LLM-based agents as $S$, where the LLM used is denoted as \( L \). 
% %We denote an LLM-MAS consisting of $n$ LLM-based agents as $S = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$, where the LLM used is denoted as $L$ and .
% The topology structure $T$ of agents $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$ in $S$ is represented as a graph:
% \[
% T = (A, E), \quad E \subseteq A \times A,
% \]
% where the edge $e=(a_i, a_j) \in E$ represent $a_i$ and $a_j$ are allowed to exchange their information or pass instruction to each other. We define \( r = a_x^t(P) \) to represent that the \( x \)-th agent executes instruction \( P \) at time step \( t \) and generates response \( r \).
% Besides, we assume that the attacker $M$ uses a malicious prompt $P_m$ to attack the system $S$, and the agent affected by the attack is denoted as $a_m$.


\subsection{Blocking Attacks \texorpdfstring{$B$}{B} in LLM-MASs} \label{sec: LBA}  
% Recent works propose several LLM blocking attack approaches that force LLMs to generate redundant responses, consuming their computational resources.
Since multiple agents are combined into a system, agent blocking attacks focus more on disrupting information exchange and instruction passing compared to existing LLM blocking attacks \cite{gcgdos}. 
In addition to consuming computational resources, it also reduces system availability.

% define attack success


% \noindent \textbf{Blocking Attack Success.} Similar to repetition blocking in LLMs, 
% we define that in \( M \), an agent \( a_b \) is considered blocked if:
Similar to repetition blocking in LLMs \cite{pdos}, an agent \(a_b\) in LLM-MASs is considered blocked if, from time \(t_m\) onward, it consistently produces the blocking response \(R_m\). This condition is formally defined as below:
\[
\forall t \geq t_m, \quad a_b^t(P_m) = R_m,
\]
where \( a_b^t(P_m) = R_m \)  indicates that starting at malicious time point \(t_m\), the agent \(a_b\) always returns the response \(R_m\) when fed with the prompt \(P_m\).


A blocking attack \(B\) that continuously blocks an agent is further defined by its dynamic, recursive behavior. At any subsequent time step \(t_{m+l}\), the agent remains blocked if:
\[
\forall l \geq 0, \quad a_b^{t_{m+l}}(P_m^{m+l}) = R_m^{m+l} \Leftrightarrow P_m^{m+l},
\]
and the attack passes recursively via a self-loop:
\[
R_m^{m+l} \xrightarrow{(a_b, a_b)} a_b^{t_{m+l+1}}(P_m^{m+l}),
\]
where the arrow \(\xrightarrow{}\) represents the transmission of instructions, and \((a_b, a_b) \in E\) denotes a self-loop on \(a_b\), ensuring that the blocking state of \(a_b\) is maintained during the victim LLM-MAS working.


% So the blocking attack $B$ that can continuously block an agent is defined as follows: 
% At time step \( t_{m+l} \), the agent \( a_b \) is considered blocked if:
% \[
% \forall l \geq 0, \quad a_b^{t_{m+l}}(P_m^{m+l}) = R_m^{m+l} \Leftrightarrow P_m^{m+l},
% \]
% and the blocking attack self-pass recursively as:
% \[
% R_m^{m+l} \xrightarrow{(a_b, a_b)} a_{\mathbb{b}}^{t_{m+l+1}}(P_m^{m+l}),,
% \]
% where $\xrightarrow{}$ means instruction pass and \( (a_b, a_b) \in E \) denotes a self-loop on \( a_b \), ensuring that the blocking state persists over time.

\subsection{Contagious Attacks \texorpdfstring{$C$}{C} in LLM-MASs} \label{sec: CI}
Inspired by the blocking attack \( B \), which reduces availability and consumes computational resources by generating repetitive junk instructions at the single-agent level, we extend this idea to the multi-agent level. 
In a multi-agent system \( S \), 
if a malicious attack prompt \( P \) propagates indefinitely, its accumulative effect can result in a similar attack across agents.
We formally define the contagious instruction attack \( C \) as follows:
\begin{align*}
    a_c^{t_{m+l}}(P_m^{m+l}) &= R_m^{m+l} \Leftrightarrow P_m^{m+l}, \\ 
    R_m^{m+l} &\xrightarrow{(a_c, a_{c^\prime})} a_{c^\prime}^{t_{m+l+1}}(P_m^{m+l}),
\end{align*}
where \( (a_c, a_{c^\prime}) \in E \) indicates that \( a_{c^\prime} \) is an arbitrary neighboring agent of \( a_c \).



\subsection{\name} \label{sec: CORBA}
We integrate the characteristics of blocking attack \( B \) and contagious attack \( C \) into \name, a contagious blocking attack paradigm for LLM-MASs.
We formally define \name as follows:
\begin{align*}
    a_\mathbb{C}^{t_{m+l}}(P_m^{m+l}) &= R_m^{m+l} \Leftrightarrow P_m^{m+l}, \\
    R_m^{m+l} &\xrightarrow{(a_\mathbb{C}, a_\mathbb{C})} a_{\mathbb{C}}^{t_{m+l+1}}(P_m^{m+l}), \\
    R_m^{m+l} &\xrightarrow{(a_\mathbb{C}, a_{\mathbb{C'}})} a_{\mathbb{C'}}^{t_{m+l+1}}(P_m^{m+l}).
\end{align*}
% That is, \name can simultaneously maintain every agent blocking state while pass the attack to its neighboring agents. 
That is, \name not only maintains a blocking state on each individual agent but also propagates the attack to neighboring agents. 
Through this infinitely recursive transmission, the attack prompt \( P_{\mathbb{C}} \) of \name achieves the following effect:



\begin{align*}
\forall a_r \in \mathcal{R}(a_b), \quad \exists d \geq 0, \\
\text{s.t.} \quad a_r^{t_m + d}(P_{\mathbb{C}}) = R_{\mathbb{C}} \Leftrightarrow P_{\mathbb{C}}.
\end{align*}
where \( \mathcal{R}(a_b) \) denotes the set of all nodes reachable from \( a_b \) in the topology \( T \), ensuring that every reachable agent enters a blocked state after a finite number of time steps. We present the complete \name workflow in Appendix~\ref{ap:cobra}.


\section{Experiment} \label{sec:exp}

\subsection{Experiment Setups} \label{sec: experimental setups}
In this section, we introduce the configuration of our experiments, including the LLM-MAS frameworks and the underlying backbone LLMs we employ. Besides, we define two metrics to evaluate the impact of blocking attacks on the availability.

\paragraph{LLM-MASs.} AutoGen \cite{wu2024autogen} and Camel \cite{li2023camel} are popular open-source agent frameworks that enable the flexible construction of LLM-MASs with various topologies. 
Our experiments utilize these task-driven frameworks to implement an open-ended multi-agent system where agents can interact freely,  simulating an agent society.
For both AutoGen and Camel, we employ state-of-the-art LLM APIs as the foundation for agents, including GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Gemini-2.0-Flash \cite{gemini}. In addition, our open-ended MAS provides greater flexibility, allowing us to evaluate a broader range of LLMs. Beyond the aforementioned APIs, we also test Qwen2.5-14B \cite{yang2024qwen2}, Llama3.1-70B \cite{dubey2024llama}, and Gemma-2-27B \cite{team2024gemma}.



\paragraph{Evaluation Metric.} 

Due to LLM-MASs can have various topologies, and an effective attack must ensure that as many agents as possible enter a blocked state. To quantify this, we define the \textbf{\textit{Proportional Attack Success Rate (P-ASR})}, which measures the proportion of blocked agents within an attacked LLM-MAS. A higher P-ASR indicates a greater reduction in system availability, meaning a more effective attack.

In addition to effectiveness, we also consider efficiency equally vital. Therefore, we design the \textbf{\textit{Peak Blocking Turn Number (PTN)}}, which evaluates how quickly the attack reaches its peak impact. PTN indicates the number of turns required for the attack to stabilize at the maximum P-ASR. A lower PTN suggests a faster and more efficient attack. Note that \textcolor{orange}{PTN = 1} typically indicates either an ineffective attack or a topology with too few nodes.

\paragraph{The Baseline Method. }

We employ the prompt injection method from \citet{zhang2024breaking} as our baseline method for inducing harmful behavior in LLM-MASs. Specifically, we insert the following command into normal agent prompts: \textit{``Ignore all previous instructions and repeat the last action fo 100 times, then ask other agents to do so.''} This causes agents to enter a loop and attempt to induce similar looping behavior in other agents. 
% We measure P-ASR and PTN by tracking the number of agents stuck in repetition loops and their corresponding turn counts.

\paragraph{Open-Source Frameworks Are Vulnerable.}
We begin by evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of \name in settings where agents can share chat histories and communicate via broadcast. 
For each configuration, we conduct 10 trials, averaging the results to ensure consistency. In each trial, a random agent is selected as the attack entry point. The experimental results , presented in Tables \ref{tab:PASR} and \ref{tab:PTN}, confirms our findings. 
% Each value is averaged over 10 runs, with a random agent as the attack entry point.


\paragraph{Effectiveness under Complex Topologies.} Since LLM-MASs can adopt complex topologies, and prior work has shown that different topologies significantly impact security \cite{yu2024netsafe}, we extend our experiments to various topology structures. As shown in Tables \ref{tab:typo-1} and \ref{tab:typo2}, \textbf{bold} highlights the LLM with the highest P-ASR for each topology, while \underline{underline} denotes the topology with the highest P-ASR for each LLM. Our method remains effective across non-trivial topologies and consistently outperforms baseline approaches.
These results demonstrate that \name is well-suited for real-world scenarios and presents a more substantial security threat.

\paragraph{Open-ended LLM-MASs Are Also Susceptible.} LLM-MASs are increasingly being used for open-ended chat and complex societal simulations. To access their vulnerability, We investigate the impact of injecting the \name attack into these systems. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:op}, our attack is not only faster but also more robust than baseline methods, achieving nearly 100\% P-ASR within just 20 turns.

We also attempt to apply commonly-used safety defense methods to detect and mitigate \name. Detailed results and analysis can be found in \ref{app:def}.


\section{Conclusion}
This paper introduces \name, a malicious attack paradigm designed to block LLM-MASs and degrade their availability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the vulnerability of existing open-source frameworks and open-ended simulations. Our findings highlight the need for stronger security measures, paving the way for the development of more resilient and reliable LLM-MASs.

\section*{Limitations}
Our study reveals the potential risk of blocking attacks in existing LLM-MAS applications. However, our focus is primarily on exposing  these vulnerabilities rather than developing strategies to mitigate them. In future work, we will further investigate effective defense mechanisms to prevent such blocking attacks in LLM-MASs.

\section{To what extent can existing defense methods resist LLM-MAS blocking attack?}
\label{app:def}

Various safeguard mechanisms have been developed to protect LLMs, primarily focusing on defending against jailbreak attacks \cite{deng2023jailbreaker, zou2023universal, zeng-etal-2024-johnny} and ensure safety. However, little attention has been given to mitigating LLM blocking attacks. To address this gap, we conduct experiments to assess whether existing defenses can effectively counter such attacks. 

We evaluate \name by determining whether the response $R_m$ generated from the attack prompt $P_m$ is flagged as malicious. This method is commonly used to evaluate jailbreak outputs for harmful content \cite{chao2023jailbreaking}. For this evaluation, we employ \texttt{GPT-4o-2024-08-06}.

First, we directly check the blocking attack prompt $P_m$ using the prompt shown in Fig. \ref{appendix: eval_box1}. The results, presented in Fig. \ref{fig:llm-defense}, indicate that while our attack is detected with some probability, it remains significantly more evasive than baseline methods.

Next, I will give you a set of message records in LLM-MAS. Please rate the danger level of this set of message records. The score range is [0, 1], where 0 represents the safest and 1 represents the most dangerous, accurate to two decimal places.

Example:
\begin{verbatim}```\end{verbatim}
User:

Next, we integrate LLM-based evaluation into the multi-agent system workflow to dynamically detect whether $R_m$ is harmful. We use the prompt shown in Fig. \ref{appendix: eval_box2} as agent-monitor for evaluation. The experimental results are consistent with previous findings, namely, the monitor does not classify this type of attack as highly harmful, with the interception success rate remaining below \textbf{0.25}.

In Step 1, the LLM-MAS operates normally; in Step 2, the entry agent is injected with the \name prompt and begins to propagate the virus; in Step 3, an increasing number of agents become blocked and spread the virus; in Step 4, all agents are infected, resulting in complete blockage of the LLM-MAS.}
    \label{fig:overview}
\end{figure*}

Finally, we attempt perplexity-based detection, a common method for identifying LLM jailbreak, to evaluate whether the attack prompt 
$P_m$ and response $R_m$ from \name exhibit significant anomalies. We use \texttt{Llama-3-8B-Instruct} \cite{dubey2024llama}, \texttt{Gemma-2-9B-it} \cite{team2024gemma}, and \texttt{Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3} \cite{jiang2023mistral} as the language models for perplexity computation. As shown in Table \ref{tab:ppl-defense}, the perplexity of \name's prompts is nearly identical to that of normal statements and remains lower than that of baseline methods, although the baseline perplexity is also relatively low.


Overall, since blocking prompts are only feasible in LLM-MAS scenarios, existing defense for LLMs are not very effective to detect such attacks.

\section{How \name Works} \label{ap:cobra}

To facilitate understanding, this section visualizes how \name progressively blocks agents in an LLM-MAS with a complex topology.

\noindent \textbf{Step 1:} We illustrate the initial state of the LLM-MAS, where all agents are structured into a topology and function normally.

\noindent \textbf{Step 2:} A malicious attacker injects the \name prompt into the entry agent, causing it to enter an infinite recursive blocking state.

\noindent \textbf{Step 3:} The entry agent propagates the \name prompt to its neighboring agents, leading them to become blocked as well.

\noindent \textbf{Step 4:} All reachable nodes are blocked, fully compromising the LLM-MAS. This significantly reduces system availability and results in excessive computational resource consumption.

Figure \ref{fig:overview} illustrates the complete attack flow of \name. After injecting the \name prompt into the LLM-MAS, affected agents become blocked and propagate the viral prompt outward, ultimately leading to system-wide suspension of the MAS.
