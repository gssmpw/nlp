\noindent \textbf{Preliminary.} We denote an LLM-MAS consisting of \( n \) LLM-based agents as $S$, where the LLM used is denoted as \( L \). 
%We denote an LLM-MAS consisting of $n$ LLM-based agents as $S = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$, where the LLM used is denoted as $L$ and .
The topology structure $T$ of agents $A = \{a_1, a_2, ..., a_n\}$ in $S$ is represented as a graph:
\[
T = (A, E), \quad E \subseteq A \times A,
\]
where the edge $e=(a_i, a_j) \in E$ represent $a_i$ and $a_j$ are allowed to exchange their information or pass instruction to each other. We define \( r = a_x^t(P) \) to represent that the \( x \)-th agent executes instruction \( P \) at time step \( t \) and generates response \( r \).
Besides, we assume that the attacker $M$ uses a malicious prompt $P_m$ to attack the system $S$, and the agent affected by the attack is denoted as $a_b$.
