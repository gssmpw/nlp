In this section, we present the text prompts utilized in the experiments from the main paper. Following baselines~\cite{ddpo, alignprop}, we used prompts in the format of “[animal name]” for experiments with the Aesthetic reward function~\cite{aesthetic} and prompts in the format of “[animal name] [activity]” for experiments with the PickScore reward function~\cite{pickscore}.
We provide the full list of the animal names and activities used to construct the prompts in Table~\ref{table:seen_prompt}.
Additionally, to evaluate generalization ability to unseen prompts, we used additional prompts that were not employed during training. 
Specifically, following the baselines~\cite{ddpo,alignprop}, we used different types of “[animal name]” and “[activity]” as unseen prompts.
We provide the full list of unseen prompts in Table\ref{table:unseen_prompt}.
Lastly, to evaluate the effectiveness of our method on more complicated prompts, we conducted experiments using the DrawBench~\cite{imagen} prompt set. 
For DrawBench, we used 58 challenging prompts categorized under “Conflicting”, “Gary Marcus et al.”, and “Reddit”.
