\section{Comparison}
\label{sec:comp}

One of the disadvantages of our model is that establishing the motion statistics incurs a communication and computation cost. We employed the Kalman Filter to predict the received power in terms of its past history, without relying on the motion statistics, in order to compare the performance of the two models. The Kalman estimation requires measurement and process error statistics, both of which can be established and updated with a modest cost \cite{elsisi2023robust}. The measurement error can be established, prior to deployment, using statistical fingerprinting. Similarly, the process error statistics, which depend on the deployment environment and gradually changing, can be established after transmitting packets for a few minutes. Once these statistics are available, the Kalman filter mixes prediction and measurement values recursively.

Figures ~\ref{fig:estimation_kalman_cc2538_crandon} and~\ref{fig:estimation_kalman_cc2538_sb} display the Kalman estimation for two of the deployments we carried out at Crandon Beach and Miami South Beach using the CC2538 radio. The corresponding error statistics are displayed in Figure ~\ref{fig:error_kalman_cc2538}. For both cases, the average error is approximately 10\% and the variances of the mean square errors are slightly bigger. By comparison, the use of acceleration statistics in our estimation model improved the estimation accuracy by about 1\%.
