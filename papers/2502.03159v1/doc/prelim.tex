\section{Preliminary}
\label{sec:prelim}

In this section, we will first introduce the open-source PIC simulator SAX \cite{sax2023} and then present our description of the PIC design task based on natural language instructions.

\subsection{SAX}
SAX is a Python library designed for S-parameter-based circuit simulation and optimization in the frequency domain, leveraging JAX for automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration. 
It provides a functional approach to modeling photonic integrated circuits, allowing users to define components and circuits using standard Python functions and dictionaries.
Given a JSON netlist specifying input/output ports, required components, their configurations, and detailed interconnections, SAX can efficiently perform mathematical analysis and simulate circuit behavior.
\subsection{Task Description}
Here we describe the PIC design task based on natural language instructions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\bullet$]
Given the natural language description of the desired circuit functionality and specified configurations, the objective is to understand and respond to user requirements and generate the simulate-ready netlist of this design.
