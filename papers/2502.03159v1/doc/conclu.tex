\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclu}
In this paper, we propose a comprehensive open-source benchmark for PIC design generation using LLMs, featuring 24 meticulously crafted PIC design problems. 
We also introduce a feedback-based prompt engineering technique that iteratively refines designs and enhances the models' design generation capabilities.
Our comprehensive evaluation of various state-of-the-art commercial LLMs highlights the significant impact of feedback mechanisms and the utilization of in-context learning capabilities on model performance. 
The results underscore both the challenges and opportunities for LLMs in the PIC design domain, providing targeted insights for future research and development to advance automation and efficiency in this field.
