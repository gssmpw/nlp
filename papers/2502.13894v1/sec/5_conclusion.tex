\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec_conclusions}
We introduced \mname , a novel approach that leverages logical reasoning and generalization capabilities of pre-trained foundation models to enhance zero-shot navigation by predicting future observations for robust action generation. By integrating temporal information and using a Hybrid Fusion framework to guide policy decisions, our approach significantly improves navigation performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate its efficiency and adaptability in both simulated and real-world environments.
