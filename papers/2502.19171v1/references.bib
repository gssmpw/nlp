%%% Notes! This is because the atsign-INBOOK citation type specifies EITHER
%%% editor or author, but not both. In my experiments with the harvard/dcu
%%% bibtex style (and presumably this applies to other styles too), bibtex
%%% ignores the editor information if author information exists in an
%%% atsign-INBOOK entry. atsign-INCOLLECTION is far more commonly used in my references,
%%% and in the absence of an editor I believe most bibtex styles will just
%%% ommit the editor from the reference - the chapter information will not
%%% end up in the in-text citation as you suggest it should be but at least
%%% there is a place to put the editor if necessary.

abstract = {SmartGardenWatering is an innovative software tool that advises gardeners on watering schedules and watering use. In this paper we investigate how expert and novice gardeners respond to advice from this piece of computer software. Do they readily accept it and adapt their activities accordingly, or do they override it with their own local knowledge? We describe the project to develop the simulation, including the design of the user interface, and a study of 20 gardeners using the tool. The focus of the study was to identify factors in the design of the software that influence how well it might intervene in ongoing gardening practice. The findings focus on what brings confidence or a lack of trust in the underlying horticultural model and its application to a particular garden. Finally, we consider how these findings might inform ongoing development of the software.},

abstract="In this paper, we present a new application of laser range-finder sensing to agricultural spraying vehicles. The current generation of spraying vehicles use automatic controllers to maintain the height of the sprayer booms above the crop. However, these control systems are typically based on ultrasonic sensors mounted on the booms, which limits the accuracy of the measurements and the response of the controller to changes in the terrain, resulting in a sub-optimal spraying process. To overcome these limitations, we propose to use a laser scanner, attached to the front of the sprayer's cabin, to scan the ground surface in front of the vehicle and to build a scrolling 3d map of the terrain. We evaluate the proposed solution in a series of field tests, demonstrating that the approach provides a more detailed and accurate representation of the environment than the current sonar-based solution, and which can lead to the development of more efficient boom control systems.",

abstract="For a comprehensive understanding of user diversity, a reliable and valid assessment of stable user characteristics is essential. In the field of human-technology interaction, a plethora of personality-related constructs linked to the experience of and interaction with technical systems has been discussed. A key question for researchers in the field is thus: Which are the key personality concepts and scales for characterizing inter-individual differences in user technology interaction? Based on a literature review and citation analysis, a structured overview of frequently used technology-related personality constructs and corresponding self-report scales is provided. Changes in the popularity and content of scales and concepts that occured over time as well as overlap between constructs and scales are discussed to facilitate scale selection.",

abstract="As robots become increasingly common in a wide variety of domains---from military and scientific applications to entertainment and home use---there is an increasing need to define and assess the trust humans have when interacting with robots. In human interaction with robots and automation, previous work has discovered that humans often have a tendency to either overuse automation, especially in cases of high workload, or underuse automation, both of which can make negative outcomes more likely. Frthermore, this is not limited to naive users, but experienced ones as well. Robotics brings a new dimension to previous work in trust in automation, as they are envisioned by many to work as teammates with their operators in increasingly complex tasks. In this chapter, our goal is to highlight previous work in trust in automation and human-robot interaction and draw conclusions and recommendations based on the existing literature. We believe that, while significant progress has been made in recent years, especially in quantifying and modeling trust, there are still several places where more investigation is needed.",
