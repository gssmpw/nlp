\begin{abstract}
%Parental involvement in homework is a crucial aspect of family education, yet it often leads to emotional strain and conflicts. Traditional methods of studying this involvement, such as one-time surveys and interviews, are susceptible to biases and fail to capture the nuanced dynamics at play. In this research, we conducted a 4-week study with 78 Chinese families, collecting 602 valid audio recordings (totalling 475 hours) alongside corresponding daily surveys that capture real-world parental homework involvement. We investigate Chinese parents' emotional shifts before and after homework involvement, identifying the common positive, natural and negative Chinese parent behaviours, and catalogued ten prevalent parent-child conflicts in Chinese families. We found that the communication style conflicts being the most frequent conflicts amount Chiense families. Notably, we found that even positive and neutral parental behaviours could be linked to conflicts, underscoring the complexity of Chiense parental homework involvement. The intersection of cultural differences and family education is a neglected area within HCI and we highlighted the in Chinese families

Parental involvement in homework is a crucial aspect of family education, but it often leads to emotional strain and conflicts that can severely impact family well-being. This paper presents findings from a 4-week in situ study involving 78 families in China, where we collected and analyzed 602 valid audio recordings (totalling 475 hours) and daily surveys. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) to analyze parent-child conversations, we gained a nuanced understanding of emotional and behavioural dynamics that overcomes the limitations of traditional one-time surveys and interviews. Our findings reveal significant emotional shifts in parents before and after homework involvement and summarise a range of positive, neutral and negative parental behaviours. We also catalogue seven common conflicts, with \textit{Knowledge Conflict} being the most frequent. Notably, we found that even well-intentioned parental behaviours, such as \textit{Unlabelled Praise}, were significantly positively correlated with specific conflict types. This work advances ubiquitous computing's research to sense and understand complex family dynamics, while offering evidence-based insights for designing future ambient intelligent systems to support healthy family education environments.
%This study advances ubiquitous computing research by demonstrating how continuous sensing and automated analysis can reveal nuanced patterns in family education practices, while offering evidence-based insights for designing future ambient intelligent systems to support healthy parent-child interactions.

%Parental involvement in homework is a crucial aspect of family education, but it often leads to emotional strain and conflicts, especially within the cultural context of China. This paper presents findings from a 4-week ubiquitous sensing study involving 78 Chinese families, where we continuously collected and analyzed 602 valid audio recordings (totalling 475 hours) and daily surveys.

Interestingly, even well-intentioned or neutral parental behaviours were found to be positively associated with conflicts, underscoring the complexity of these interactions.

%PCS version: Parental involvement in homework is important for family education but often leads to emotional strain and conflicts, especially within China's cultural context. This paper presents findings from a 4-week in-situ study involving 78 Chinese families, collecting 602 audio recordings (totalling 475 hours) and daily surveys. Utilising LLMs to analyze parent-child conversations, we gained a nuanced understanding of emotional and behavioural dynamics that traditional surveys and interviews miss. Our findings reveal significant emotional shifts in parents before and after homework and identify positive, neutral and negative parental behaviours. We also catalogue seven common conflicts, with knowledge conflict being the most frequent. Interestingly, even well-intentioned or neutral parental behaviours were positively associated with conflicts, underscoring the complexity of these interactions. This study contributes to a neglected area in HCI by exploring the intersection of family education and Chinese cultural norms, offering insights for designing technologies to improve parenting practices in China.
