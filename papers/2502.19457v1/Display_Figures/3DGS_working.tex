    \caption{An overview of the 3DGS forward process. (a) The splatting step maps 3D Gaussians into the image plane. (b) 3DGS partitions the image into non-overlapping patches, referred to as tiles. (c) For Gaussians spanning multiple tiles, 3DGS duplicates them and assigns each a unique identifier, i.e., a tile ID. (d) Rendering the sorted Gaussians yields the pixel data for each tile. Note that the pixel and tile computation workflows are independent, enabling parallel processing. Best viewed in color. Figure inspired from~\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2401-03890}.}
