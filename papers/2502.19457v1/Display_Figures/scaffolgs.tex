    \caption{\textbf{Overview of the ScaffoldGS pipeline.} (a) A sparse voxel grid is initialized from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)-derived points, with each \textbf{anchor} placed at the voxel center and assigned a learnable scale, capturing the scene’s occupancy. (b) Within the view frustum, \textbf{k Gaussians} are generated from each \textit{visible anchor} with offsets \(\{O_k\}\), and their attributes—including opacity, color, scale, and quaternion—are decoded from the anchor feature. (c) To enhance efficiency and reduce redundancy, only significant Gaussians (\(\alpha \geq \tau_\alpha\)) are rasterized. The final rendered image is optimized using reconstruction loss.
