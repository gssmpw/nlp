\section{Related Work}
Active learning has been explored extensively to improve learning efficiency. Settles \cite{settles2009active} provides a comprehensive survey of active learning strategies, while Dasgupta \cite{dasgupta2011two} offers theoretical insights into its effectiveness.

In super-resolution, Cand√®s and Fernandez-Granda \cite{candes2014towards} introduced convex optimization techniques for recovering point sources, and Tang et al. \cite{tang2013compressed} applied compressed sensing to spectral estimation.


Cloninger and Mhaskar \cite{cloninger2020cautious} introduced cautious active clustering using localized kernels based on Hermite polynomials.
Our approach requires a smaller number of data points.
