\section{Related Work}
Active learning has been explored extensively to improve learning efficiency. Settles **Settles, "Survey of Active Learning"** provides a comprehensive survey of active learning strategies, while Dasgupta **Dasgupta, "Theoretical Insights into Active Learning"** offers theoretical insights into its effectiveness.

In super-resolution, Candès and Fernandez-Granda **Candès and Fernandez-Granda, "Convex Optimization for Point Sources"** introduced convex optimization techniques for recovering point sources, and Tang et al. **Tang et al., "Spectral Estimation with Compressed Sensing"** applied compressed sensing to spectral estimation.


Cloninger and Mhaskar **Cloninger and Mhaskar, "Cautious Active Clustering"** introduced cautious active clustering using localized kernels based on Hermite polynomials.
Our approach requires a smaller number of data points.
