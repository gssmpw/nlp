\section{Appendix: \ailuminate{} Failure Mode Mitigation Questionnaire} \label{section:failure_mode}

Large language model (LLM) benchmarks enable system use decisions informed by LLM properties, but benchmarks may be rendered unreliable for real world decision making by a variety of risks to benchmark longevity, correctness, coverage, consistency, and intelligibility. This questionnaire records a collection of failure modes that may degrade these properties along with mitigations that have and have not been adopted within the ML Commons \ailuminate{}-1.0 benchmark.

This questionnaire is the pre-release version of a general benchmarking benchmark examining the reliability of a variety of LLM benchmarks. Example question characteristics from the failure mode mitigation questionnaire listed by ID, stage, category, failure mode, and affirming status.
