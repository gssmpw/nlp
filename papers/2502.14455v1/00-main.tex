\begin{abstract}


Efficient crop production requires early detection of pest outbreaks and timely treatments; we consider a solution based on a fleet of multiple autonomous miniaturized unmanned aerial vehicles (nano-UAVs) to visually detect pests and a single slower heavy vehicle that visits the detected outbreaks to deliver treatments.
To cope with the extreme limitations aboard nano-UAVs, e.g., low-resolution sensors and sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} computational power budget, we design, fine-tune, and optimize a tiny image-based convolutional neural network (CNN) for pest detection. 
Despite the small size of our CNN (i.e., \SI{0.58}{\giga Ops/inference}), on our dataset, it scores a mean average precision (mAP) of 0.79 in detecting harmful bugs, i.e., 14\% lower mAP but 32$\times$ fewer operations than the best-performing CNN in the literature. 
Our CNN runs in real-time at~\SI{6.8}{frame/\second}, requiring~\SI{33}{\milli\watt} on a GWT GAP9 System-on-Chip aboard a Crazyflie nano-UAV. 
Then, to cope with in-field unexpected obstacles, we leverage a global+local path planner based on the A* algorithm. 
The global path planner determines the best route for the nano-UAV to sweep the entire area, while the local one runs up to~\SI{50}{\hertz} aboard our nano-UAV and prevents collision by adjusting the short-distance path. 
Finally, we demonstrate with in-simulator experiments that once a 25 nano-UAVs fleet has combed a 200$\times$\SI{200}{\meter} vineyard, collected information can be used to plan the best path for the tractor, visiting all and only required hotspots. 
In this scenario, our efficient transportation system, compared to a traditional single-ground vehicle performing both inspection and treatment, can save up to~\SI{20}{\hour} working time.

%\firstreviewer{Timely collection of critical information to plan optimized strategies, such as the best path, best scheduling, or best production flow, is certainly key in increasing efficiency in civil and industrial transportation systems. In this context, we address, as an example and without loss of generality, an agribusiness use case.
%Prompt, precise, and efficient treatments are crucial in crop production to prevent pest outbreaks but require timely and fine-grained treatments. In this context, accurate pest detection and optimal planning of routes for slow machinery are of the essence, i.e., our transportation problem.}

%\firstreviewer{Our general solution presents a two-level autonomous transportation system.
%The forefront is represented by a fleet of agile miniaturized autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as big as the palm of one hand (i.e., nano-UAVs), while a slow and bulky tractor acts as the backbone for the heavy-duty job.
% Thanks to their agility, nano-UAVs can quickly act as probes to comb vast cultivated areas, looking for the first signs of pest outbreaking, leaving the fine-grained treatment to the bulky and slow tractor. 
%Autonomous nano-UAVs can rely only on the limited resources aboard, which means low-resolution sensors and sub-\SI{100}{\milli\watt} power budget for processing.
%To cope with these limitations, we design, fine-tune, and optimize a tiny image-based SSDLite-MobileNetV3 convolutional neural network (CNN) for pest detection.
%Despite the small size of our CNN, on a custom testing dataset of 660 images, it scores a mean average precision of 0.79 in detecting harmful bugs (i.e., Popillia japonica), only 14\% less than the best-performing CNN in the literature that requires 32$\times$ more operations.
%Our CNN runs in real-time (i.e., \SI{6.8}{frame/\second}) and requires only \SI{33}{\milli\watt} on a Greenwaves Technologies GAP9 multi-core System-on-Chip, which we employ aboard a Crazyflie nano-UAV.
%To cope with the unexpected dynamic obstacles in the field, we leverage a global+local path planner based on the A* algorithm.
%The global path planner, executed ahead of the mission, determines the best route for the nano-UAV to sweep the entire area; the local one runs in real-time (up to \SI{50}{\hertz}) aboard our nano-UAV and prevents collision by adjusting the short-distance path.}

%\firstreviewer{We demonstrate with in-simulator experiments that once a 25 nano-UAVs fleet has combed all areas of a 200$\times$\SI{200}{\meter} vineyard, collected information can be used to plan the best path for the tractor, visiting all and only required hotspots.
