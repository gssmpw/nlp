Faster R-CNN [1] and its variants have been widely used for object detection tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) as the region proposal network (RPN) and the classification network enables the model to capture rich features from images and detect objects with high accuracy.

However, the computational cost of Faster R-CNN can be high due to the need for multiple forward passes through the CNN. To address this issue, researchers have proposed various acceleration techniques, including GPU-based parallelization [2] and optimized data structures [3].

In addition to object detection, our system also requires efficient routing algorithms to enable the autonomous transportation of nano-UAVs between locations. For global routing, we use a graph-based approach with a cost metric that minimizes travel time while considering fuel consumption and physical maneuverability constraints.

For local routing, we adopt a reactive planning approach using the dynamic window approach (DWA) for optimal velocity planning and an improved follow the gap method (FGM) for obstacle avoidance. This combination of algorithms enables our system to navigate through complex environments while avoiding collisions with static and dynamic obstacles.

To enable efficient onboard computation on resource-constrained devices, we use lightweight cost metrics that can be computed in real-time. Our approach provides a solution for obstacle avoidance that can run on nano-UAVs in real-time, allowing the detection of static and dynamic obstacles with maximum speeds ranging from 4.5 to 19.5 meters per second.

The graph-based solution for obstacle avoidance proposed in this work is novel and provides the first solution relying only on onboard computations. Our approach also enables the complete transportation system composed of nano-UAVs and a ground robot, providing a drastic reduction of time for early detected insect hotspots.
