\section{Implementation of dynamic PHY frame configuration}

\subsection{OAI Phy-test}
Exaplin the implementation details in OAI PHY-test mode along with the OAI limitations, for understanding the performance in a standard compliant protocol stack with certain bounds.

\subsection{Scalability studies in Simulation}
Explain the implementation details in simulation mode. We show the capability of our proposed solution when it is not bounded by OAI limitations.

% We could not use the testbed - OAI limitation - UE - GNB on the fly breaking
%  SO we use phy test mode - describe phy test mode in general
%  Describe our setup - 
%  Python server running in the same machine 
%       does resource allocation and prediction (100 % accuracy) 

%  We drove around a major city in US - all 3 operators - used S21 phones and XCAL Solo devices to record low level KPIs - extracted MCS/SINR/.... at 10 ms granularity 

%  we simulate for two users
