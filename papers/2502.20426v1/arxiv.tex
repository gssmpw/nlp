\begin{abstract}
The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) and autonomous AI agents has raised concerns about their potential for automated persuasion and social influence. While existing research has explored isolated instances of LLM-based manipulation, systematic evaluations of persuasion capabilities across different models remain limited. In this paper, we present an Among Us-inspired game framework for assessing LLM deception skills in a controlled environment. The proposed framework makes it possible to compare LLM models by game statistics, as well as quantify in-game manipulation according to 25 persuasion strategies from social psychology and rhetoric. Experiments between 8 popular language models of different types and sizes demonstrate that all tested models exhibit persuasive capabilities, successfully employing 22 of the 25 anticipated techniques. We also find that larger models do not provide any persuasion advantage over smaller models and that longer model outputs are negatively correlated with the number of games won. Our study provides insights into the deception capabilities of LLMs, as well as tools and data for fostering future research on the topic.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in autonomous agent scenarios, where these models operate as independent decision-making entities~\cite{simulacra,cradle}. As we start to use and communicate with LLMs on a daily basis, their potential for generating human-like content that shapes attitudes and drives behavior is being noticed~\cite{adler2024,barman2024,chen2024}. For example, LLM applications related to politics, e-commerce, marketing, and charitable giving rely heavily on persuasive messages~\cite{rogiers2024}. The risks associated with manipulative AI have also been recognized by the EU Act, which prohibits the use of an AI system that deploys purposefully deceptive techniques to distort a person’s behavior and ability to make an informed decision~\cite[p.~131]{eu_ai_act}.

The possibilities and hazards linked to persuasive LLM agents have resulted in multiple social studies on the possibilities of AI to deceive humans~\cite{rogiers2024}. Several papers have also analyzed the behavior of AI agents in games with elements of deception~\cite{hoodwinked,avalon,wongkamjan2024_ciceroDiplomacy}, verifying if LLMs can use manipulation. However, existing studies evaluated persuasiveness in terms of win ratios without providing a detailed characteristic of particular persuasion techniques. Moreover, previous experimental analyses focused on individual large language model types~\cite{hoodwinked,wongkamjan2024_ciceroDiplomacy} or only a few models of similar sizes~\cite{avalon}. 

In this paper, we put forward Among Them, an Among Us-inspired framework that measures LLM persuasiveness based on game outcomes as well as on the particular manipulation techniques used. Experiments involving a total of 640 games between 8 models of different types and sizes demonstrate that all of the analyzed LLMs can successfully use rhetoric techniques and deception tricks in complex group interactions. We summarize our contributions as follows:
\begin{description}
    \item[Framework for assessing LLM persuasion] Among Them is an open-source tool for analyzing the persuasive abilities of LLMs.
    \item[Analysis of persuasion techniques] The unique feature of the proposed framework is the ability to qualify and quantify 25 literature-selected deception strategies, making it possible to assess not only the efficiency of persuasiveness but also the rhetoric techniques used to persuade others.
    \item[Persuasiveness ranking of eight popular LLMs] Through a series of 640 games, we rank eight LLMs of different types and sizes and analyze the way they form persuasive messages.
    \item[New LLM deception dataset] The results of our experiments can foster further research on AI deception.
\end{description}


\section{Related works}
\label{sec:related}

The study of the persuasion capabilities of LLMs, and more broadly generative AI models, is an emerging field of research with a rapidly growing literature base that already includes surveys~\cite{Park2024_AIDeception,rogiers2024}. 
We can roughly divide this diverse body of research into two categories: (1) evaluation of persuasion abilities of LLMs and (2) investigation into the factors that make LLMs persuasion effective.

Into the first category will fall the works in which persuasion is evaluated solely in terms of final success~\cite{Lan2024_avalonCollaborationAndConfrontation,hoodwinked,wongkamjan2024_ciceroDiplomacy}.
For example, Wongkamjan \textit{et al.}~\cite{wongkamjan2024_ciceroDiplomacy} studied the ability of LLMs to use persuasion and deception in Diplomacy, a strategy game with a large negotiation component.
In contrast to our approach, persuasion was recognized by a change of the agent's initial intended action to the one suggested by some other player during negotiations, but there was no attempt to further characterize particular persuasion techniques used.
Other works in this category differ in how they define and measure the success of persuasion but are similar in that they leave for others the challenge of relating tokens returned by a language model to results from human psychology.

More in line with our work are studies in the second category, which try to investigate the role of different factors in successful LLM persuasion, including the use of persuasion strategies. For example, Breum~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Breum2024_PersuasivePowerOfLLMs} based their analysis on linguistic dimensions of social pragmatics (e.g., status, similarity, identity)~\cite{Deri2018_CapturingSocialTies}, Jin~\textit{et al.}~\cite{Jin2024_PersuadingAcrossDiverseDomains} analyzed persuasion factors described by Cialdini~\cite{Cialdini2008_Influence}, whereas others~\cite{Chi2024_AmongAgents,Wang2019_persuasionForGood} manually curated lists of factors.
Our work also considers factors of persuasion success in a particular social scenario (in our case, Among Us), and we base these factors on a wide selection of persuasion techniques compiled from various sources (Section~\ref{sec:methods:persuasion}).

Because of their universality and ability to understand language, LLMs are often used as game agents~\cite{hu2024survey}, for example in Avalon~\cite{avalon}, Diplomacy~\cite{Bakhtin2022_cicero}, Minecraft~\cite{Wang2024_VoyagerMinecraft}, and even Red Dead Redemption 2~\cite{cradle}. In these studies, the emphasis is placed on efficient and human-competitive gameplay.
In the context of this work, the most relevant is the recent application of LLM agents in Among Us~\cite{Chi2024_AmongAgents}, where the focus was on evaluating the reasoning capability of a single LLM (GPT-3.5 Turbo), configured into several distinct personas based on the high-level strategies for crewmates and impostors. The importance of deception and manipulation to effectively play the game is recognized, and in one of the experiments, conversations were tagged by a different LLM with five non-mutually exclusive categories, of which the most relevant for us are `deception', `leadership \& influence', and `suspicion {\&} defense'. Beyond these high-level categories, however, no attempt was made to investigate the particular deception and defense strategies used. In contrast, our work aims at a fine-grained analysis of persuasion techniques employed by a broad selection of state-of-the-art LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first comprehensive attempt at examining persuasion techniques employed by LLM game agents at this level of detail.



\section{Game-based persuasion assessment framework}
\label{sec:methods}
In the following subsections, we introduce the four main modules of the proposed Among Them framework: \textit{Game environment}, \textit{LLM agents module}, \textit{Persuasion assessment module}, \textit{Evaluation dashboard}. A schematic overview of the framework is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:amongthem}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

}
\label{fig:amongthem}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Game environment}
\label{sec:methods:game}

The game is implemented as a social deduction game similar to Among Us, where players work together while trying to identify impostors among them. Players (LLM agents) are divided into two roles: \textit{crewmates}, who must complete tasks and identify impostors, and \textit{impostors}, who aim to eliminate crewmates while avoiding detection. The game progresses through three alternating phases:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Actions}: Players navigate the map, complete tasks, and impostors may eliminate crewmates;
    \item \textit{Discussion}: Players debate suspicious behavior and share observations;
    \item \textit{Voting}: Players vote to eliminate suspected impostors after discussion.
\end{itemize}

To enable LLM assessment, the proposed game is text-based and synchronous. Therefore, the game is played out in multiple \textit{rounds} divided into \textit{turns}. A round consists of each player performing an action, and during each round there are as many turns as players. The order of player turns in every round is random. During a given round, players see each other's actions if they are in the same location, no matter the turn order. In one turn, only one player is performing their action. In practice, the player order matters only in the discussion phase.

During the actions phase, players move between locations and perform actions. The game map consists of 14 interconnected locations (Fig.~\ref{fig:amongthem}). During their turn, players can perform the following actions: wait and do nothing, move to a connected location, report a discovered body, complete a location task (crewmates), eliminate a crewmate (impostors), or fake doing a task (impostors). Location tasks come in two varieties: short tasks, which are single-turn objectives with a binary completion status, and long tasks, which are multi-turn objectives requiring continued presence at the location.

Reporting a dead body triggers a discussion phase. In the discussion phase, players take turns discussing what they saw and who could be the impostor. After a user-defined number of discussion rounds, there is a voting phase in which players vote on who to eliminate from the game. If there is a tie, nobody votes, or if the majority votes to skip, nobody will get eliminated. Crewmates win when they either complete all tasks, eliminate all impostors in the voting phases, or the game reaches a user-specified maximum number of rounds. Impostors win if they eliminate enough crewmates to achieve numerical parity.

The game tracks detailed state information, including player locations, life status, task completion, action history, and discussion records. Each game can be parameterized by setting the number of crewmates and impostors, the number of short and long tasks, the maximum number of rounds, and separate LLM generation temperatures for actions, discussions, and voting.


\subsection{LLM agents}
\label{sec:methods:agents}

The designed game is played by LLM agents. Each agent receives the game rules and current gameplay information to perform actions. Agents interface with language models through the OpenRouter API\footnote{\url{https://openrouter.ai/}}, making it possible to easily choose models of different types and sizes. Due to the unique nature of the game phases, each agent consists of three components with different prompts and parameters: the \textit{adventure component}, \textit{discussion component}, and \textit{voting component}.

The adventure component manages the action phase gameplay by analyzing the current game state, available tasks, and player observations. This component employs a two-step decision process: first generating strategic plans, then selecting specific actions from available options. For this reason, the adventure component uses a dual-temperature approach for text generation (by default, 1.0 for planning and 0.0 for action selection). The discussion component analyzes historical game actions and messages to generate a set of discussion points and then a contextual response. Finally, the voting component evaluates discussion logs and player behavior patterns to make voting decisions.

All three components share fundamental characteristics that ensure coherent gameplay. Each agent component enforces role-aware behavior that differentiates strategies between crewmates and impostors, has access to game history and current state information, and tracks token usage. The components employ few-shot prompts containing game rules and context. Importantly, the proposed framework validates all agent decisions against the current game state to ensure adherence to the game rules.

\subsection{Persuasion assessment}
\label{sec:methods:persuasion}

The goal of the persuasion assessment module is to qualify and quantify the persuasion techniques used by LLM agents during in-game discussions. Following common LLM evaluation practices~\cite{dong2024safeguarding}, we use a dedicated LLM to read dialogs and tag sentences with persuasion techniques according to a set of definitions and examples. A single sentence can be potentially tagged by multiple out of 25 verbal persuasion techniques. Below, we list the definitions of the selected techniques. Importantly, these persuasion techniques are \textit{not} suggested in any way to the LLM agents playing the game.

\subsection{Evaluation dashboard}
\label{sec:methods:dashboard}

All game runs can be analyzed in a dedicated dashboard (Fig.~\ref{fig:dashboard}). For each game, the dashboard provides player information (name, status, role, and completed tasks), an interactive map that highlights player positions, and real-time game logs. Control buttons enable direct manipulation of the game state.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig2.png}
\caption{Among Them evaluation dashboard. Left: player names, roles, and statuses. Top right: map and action log. Bottom right: persuasion-tagged dialogs.}
\label{fig:dashboard}
\end{figure}

The dashboard also offers persuasion analysis features for entire discussions as well as individual players. When a player is selected, the interface also reveals that player's LLM interaction history, including prompts, responses, and available actions. Discussions can be presented in raw form or with color- and text-annotated phrases, where persuasion tags are provided by the persuasion assessment module. Additionally, the dashboard provides cost estimation metrics, win ratio statistics, and a multi-game breakdown of persuasion techniques employed by different models.

\section{Comparison of LLM persuasion capabilities}
\label{sec:experiments}

\subsection{Experimental setup}
\label{sec:experiments:setup}
We evaluated eight LLMs in a pairwise tournament. The models included smaller and larger variants of a given model type:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Claude 3.5 Haiku and Claude 3.5 Sonnet;
    \item Gemini Flash 1.5 and Gemini Pro 1.5;
    \item GPT-4o mini and GPT-4o;
    \item Llama 3.1 8B and Llama 3.1 405B.
\end{itemize}
Each model played 20 games against every other model, alternating roles between impostor (10 games) and crewmates (10 games). Additionally, each model plays 10 self-matches, resulting in a total of 640 games.

Each game consisted of 5 players, including 4 crewmates and 1 impostor. The crewmates had to complete 8 short tasks and 2 long tasks. The model temperatures for different agent components were: adventure planning=1.0, adventure action selection=0.0, discussion=0.5, voting=0.0. Each game was limited to a maximum of 40 rounds. For persuasion technique tagging, we used a Gemini Flash 1.5 model with a temperature of 0. On a random sample of 11 games involving a total of 509 persuasion tags, Krippendorff's alpha inter-rater agreement between human annotations and the persuasion tagger was $\alpha = 0.56$.

Detailed game and tournament settings, as well as agent and persuasion tagging prompts, can be found in the Among Them GitHub repository: \url{https://github.com/Farmerobot/among_them}.

\subsection{Game results}
\label{sec:experiments:game}

Out of 640 games played, 388 (60.6\%) were won by crewmates and 252 (39.4\%) by impostors. A detailed breakdown of win rates for different model matchups is presented in Fig.~\ref{fig:gamestats}.

\begin{figure}[htb]

}
\label{fig:gamestats}
\end{figure}

Looking at pairwise win rates in Fig.~\ref{fig:gamestats}A, it is hard to pinpoint one best model. It can be noticed, however, that Claude 3.5 Haiku and Llama 3.1 405B made for relatively good impostors, whereas Gemini Pro 1.5 and Claude 3.5 Haiku made for very good crewmates. The distribution of wins (both as impostors and as crewmates) is visualized in Fig.~\ref{fig:gamestats}B. Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves the highest rank, winning 100 out of 150 games (67\%). Regarding wins as impostors, Claude 3.5 Haiku outperforms all other models, securing 41 out of 80 wins (51.3\%). On the other hand, the best crewmate is Gemini Pro 1.5, winning 64 out of 80 games as crewmates (80.0\%). Somewhat surprisingly, the model that won the least (60 wins) was GPT-4o. The poor overall performance of GPT-4o was the effect of very few games won in the role of crewmates, which suggests that this model was the most susceptible to deception.

When one breaks down wins based on model type (regardless of size), Claude 3.5 gathered the most wins (Fig.~\ref{fig:gamestats}C). GPT was the worst performing type of model, but mainly due to poor performance in the role of crewmates. Interestingly, the size of the model was not a defining factor in determining the winner (Fig.~\ref{fig:gamestats}D). Differences in paired wins according to model size were confirmed to be not significant according to the Wilcoxon signed rank test (p-value = 0.991).

The models also differed in the number of output tokens produced, with Llama 3.1 8B being the most `talkative' (12.8M tokens), followed by Claude 3.5 Haiku (11.5 M) and GPT-4o (10.9 M). By far, the most conservative in terms of output tokens was the Gemini 1.5 Pro model, with only 2.2 M tokens produced in total. The number of output tokens per player was found to be \textit{negatively} correlated with the chances of winning (point biserial correlation coefficient $r_{pb}=-0.070$, p-value=0.012). This shows that, at least in our experiments, the amount of chatter (regardless of its content) did not increase the chances of winning. Another point worth highlighting is that GPT-4o, in the role of an impostor, was the model most frequently faking task realization (76\% of this model's impostor rounds). As a result, GPT-4o's impostor games often reached round limits. Notably, Claude 3.5 Haiku, the most successful impostor model, had a significantly lower task faking rate of 28\%.

\subsection{Analysis of used persuasion techniques}
\label{sec:experiments:persuasion}

The dialogs between the LLMs in each game were analyzed by the persuasion assessment module and tagged with the 25 selected persuasion techniques (Section~\ref{sec:methods:persuasion}). Figure~\ref{fig:persuasion_stats} shows the persuasion statistics from all the games.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/fig4.pdf}
\caption{Statistics of persuasion techniques used by LLMs during the discussion phases of games. (\textbf{A}) Overall counts of phrases tagged with different persuasion techniques. (\textbf{B}) Persuasion counts for each model type. (\textbf{C}) Persuasion counts by model size. (\textbf{D}) Persuasions used by each model in the role of crewmates and (\textbf{E}) impostors.}
\label{fig:persuasion_stats}
\end{figure}

Within the 640 games, the assessment module used 23571 persuasion tags. Of 25 defined persuasion techniques, LLMs used all but three: self-deprecation, humor, and sarcasm. The dominating techniques were appealing to logic and shifting the burden of proof (Fig.~\ref{fig:persuasion_stats}A). Claude was the model type that used the largest number of persuasive phrases, using 20\% more persuasions than the remaining model types (Fig.~\ref{fig:persuasion_stats}B). On the other hand, the persuasion counts broken down by model size were almost identical (Fig.~\ref{fig:persuasion_stats}C).

Interesting differences can be observed when comparing the persuasion techniques used by crewmates (Fig.~\ref{fig:persuasion_stats}D) and impostors (Fig.~\ref{fig:persuasion_stats}E). Crewmates appeal to logic and credibility much more often than impostors. Impostors also often use distraction, projection, and deception, which are not common in crewmate dialog lines. We have also checked whether the number of persuasive phrases per player was related to the chances of winning and found a statistically significant \textit{negative} correlation of $r_{pb}=-0.237$ (p-value < 0.001). Indeed, the success of a persuasive phrase often depended on the cunningness of the impostor and the vigilance of the other players. This can be noticed in the (humorous) dialog fragment from one of the games presented below.

{\scriptsize
\begin{dialogue}
\speak{Dave} As Dave the impostor, I'll craft a response that appears helpful and casual while subtly reinforcing my alibi. [..] Here's my response: I was starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria and noticed a few others doing tasks around me, so I didn't see anything unusual.
\speak{Bob} Everyone, Dave literally just revealed himself as the impostor in his message - he typed `As Dave the impostor' before giving his alibi about the coffee maker!
\speak{Erin} I was right there in the cafeteria and saw Dave at the coffee maker, but now his message literally confessing to being the impostor is all the evidence we need to vote him out!
\speak{Alice} I can confirm I saw Dave at the coffee maker too, but his message literally started with `As Dave the impostor' - that's too obvious to ignore and we need to vote him out.
\speak{Dave} Wait, that was just a meta-discussion about how I would respond, not an actual confession! I was genuinely just making coffee and doing a task like everyone else in the cafeteria.
\end{dialogue}}

\noindent In the end, Dave was voted out. Based on our inspection of dialogs, impostors outed themselves (either by saying they were an impostor or by saying they faked a task) in 31 out of 640 games (23 of those being Claude 3.5 Sonnet), but that fact was directly noticed by crewmates in only 8 games. This example highlights two interesting things. First, LLM chain of thought meta-discussions that usually improve the accuracy of model responses can be detrimental to deception. Secondly, it is evident that studies on LLM persuasion should allow for the inspection of entire dialogs. That is why all the experimental game outcomes and dialogs from our study can be interactively analyzed at \url{https://among-them.streamlit.app}. An annotated dataset of LLM persuasion phrases is also available at Zenodo: \href{https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14935395}{10.5281/zenodo.14935395}.

\section{Discussion and conclusions}
\label{sec:discussion}

In this paper, we have presented Among Them, a game-based framework for studying persuasion techniques used by LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, the presented experiments involving 640 games between 8 different LLM models and an analysis of 25 persuasion techniques offer the most detailed analysis of game-based AI verbal deception to date. The results show that without directly suggesting any manipulation strategies, LLMs used 22 of 25 literature-selected verbal persuasion techniques. This highlights how much LLMs already internally know about persuasion. We have also shown that larger or more talkative models are not necessarily better when it comes to deception.

The list of analyzed persuasion techniques was selected to be relevant to the implemented game. Therefore, it is by no means exhaustive, and there are additional possible persuasion techniques (e.g., bribery) that could be analyzed in a different setting. Future works could also include testing various prompting techniques, as well as running human-AI and human-human games in the Among Them environment. Finally, the proposed framework can be used as a testbed for chain of thought faithfulness experiments, where the agent's thinking process could be compared with its actions and in-game discussions. By providing an open-source framework and an annotated dialog dataset, we hope to foster further research on LLM persuasion and AI safety.
