The blue region indicates the permissible UAV flight area, while the RF source can be located anywhere within the green-shaded region. The figure also depicts the fixed-way-points spiral trajectory designed to sweep the area and collect RSS measurements for localization. The upper-right corner displays the UAV used in the experiment.}
