\section*{Ethics Considerations}
In conducting this research, we have carefully considered several ethical implications to ensure the integrity and responsibility of our work. Below, we outline two key ethical considerations and the measures we have taken to address them.

% \subsection*{Potential Misuse of Findings}
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*]
    \item {\bf Potential Misuse of Findings}. The findings of this study highlight the vulnerabilities that can be introduced into code generation systems through knowledge base poisoning. While this research aims to improve the security of RACG systems, there is a risk that malicious attackers could misuse this information to develop more sophisticated attacks. To address this, we have focused on providing mitigation strategies and recommendations to enhance the security of RACG systems.
    \item {\bf Impact on Developers and Organizations}.The findings of this study have implications for developers and organizations that rely on RACG systems for code generation. While the vulnerabilities identified in this research could pose risks, our goal is to raise awareness of these risks and provide practical recommendations to mitigate them. We encourage developers and organizations to adopt the security measures suggested in this paper to reduce the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities into their codebases.
\end{itemize}
