\section{Experimental Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

We evaluate \X{}'s overheads on performance and DRAM energy consumption for existing and future DRAM chips, by sweeping \gls{nrh} from \param{1K} down to \param{20}.
\ous{0}{We consider \param{two} \X{} \om{6}{variants} to separately assess the effects of \om{6}{Concurrent Counter Update (CCU) and Chronus Back-Off:}
1) \om{6}{\emph{\X{}}}, our complete proposal that implements \om{7}{both} CCU \emph{and} Chronus Back-Off and
2) \X{} with \gls{prac} Back-Off (\om{6}{\emph{\X{}-PB}}), which implements \om{7}{only CCU and}, \om{4}{like \gls{prac}}, \emph{always} sends \param{four} preventive refreshes \emph{with} a delay period (i.e., \gls{prac}-4 with CCU).}

\head{\ous{6}{Comparison Points}} We compare \X{} to \gls{prac}~\cite{jedec2024jesd795c}, \gls{prfm}~\cite{jedec2024jesd795c}, and \param{three} \ous{2}{state-of-the-art} read disturbance mitigation mechanisms:
1) \om{6}{\emph{Graphene}}~\cite{park2020graphene}, a \om{4}{deterministic} mechanism that \ous{4}{uses the Misra-Gries frequent item counting algorithm~\cite{misra1982finding} and maintains frequently accessed row counters} completely within the \om{4}{memory controller}; 
2) \om{6}{\emph{PARA}}~\cite{kim2014flipping}, a \om{4}{probabilistic} \om{5}{memory-controller-based} mechanism that does \emph{not} maintain any counters; and
3) \om{6}{\emph{Hydra}}~\cite{qureshi2022hydra}, a \om{4}{deterministic} mechanism that maintains counters in the DRAM chip and caches them in the \om{4}{memory controller}.
\ous{9}{Appendix \ref{apx:abacuscomparison}} compares \X{} to ABACuS, a storage-optimized deterministic mechanism that maintains counters in the memory controller.\footnote{We evaluate ABACuS separately because \ous{9}{ABACuS performs} best with ABACuS's own DRAM address mapping configuration (as described in~\cite{olgun2024abacus}).}
To evaluate performance and DRAM energy consumption, we conduct cycle-level simulations using Ramulator 2.0~\cite{ramulator2github, luo2023ramulator2}, integrated with DRAMPower~\cite{drampower}.
We extend Ramulator 2.0~\cite{ramulator2github, luo2023ramulator2} with the implementations of \X{} \om{4}{and open source all of our code and scripts~\cite{chronusgithub}}.
We use the same system configuration and workloads in~\secref{sec:sensitivity}.
