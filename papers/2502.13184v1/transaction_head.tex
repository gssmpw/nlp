\begin{IEEEbiography}[{\includegraphics[width=1in,height=1.25in,clip,keepaspectratio]{img/Author3_Dietmayer}}]{Klaus Dietmayer}
	(Senior Member, IEEE) earned his degree in electrical engineering from the Technical University of Braunschweig, Germany and completed his Ph.D. in 1994 at the University of the Armed Forces, Hamburg, Germany. Afterwards, he began his industrial career as a research engineer at Philips Semiconductors, Hamburg, progressing through various roles to become the manager for sensors and actuators in the automotive electronics division. 
	
	In 2000, Dietmayer was appointed as a Professor of Measurement and Control at the University of Ulm. He currently serves as the Director of the Institute for Measurement, Control, and Microtechnology within the School of Engineering and Computer Science.
	
	His primary research interests include information fusion, multi-object tracking, environment perception, situation assessment, and behavior planning for autonomous driving. The institute operates three automated test vehicles with special licenses for public road traffic, along with a test intersection equipped with infrastructure sensors for evaluating automated and networked cooperative driving in Ulm.
