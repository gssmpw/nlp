    \caption{\textbf{The percentage to choose the smallest possible degree node on different part of the serialization for all BA graphs} It reinforces our observations in \cref{sec:comp-other-algs}. In addition, we also observe that algorithms similar to \deggreedy (\deggreedy and \gflownets) and good-performing algorithms (\onlinemis, \redumis, \isco, and \lwd) have clearly different characteristics across various $(n,m)$, described in \cref{sec:more-exp-serialization}.}
