    \caption{\textbf{The percentage to choose the smallest possible degree node on different part of the (degree-based) serialization.} We find that the best algorithms (\onlinemis, \redumis, \isco) and the best performing learning-based algorithm \lwd share a similar characteristic pattern, that they have high consistency with degree-based greedy on second and third part of the serialization, while on the first part there is a low consistency. On the other hand, \pcqo and \difusco has low consistency with degree-based greedy in general.}
