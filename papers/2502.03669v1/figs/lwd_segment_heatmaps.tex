    \caption{\textbf{Percentage of the smallest possible degree node in the pseudo-natural serialization of \lwd, i.e., behaves similarly to degree-based greedy, for the 3 equal parts of the serialization, and the overal average} From the overall heatmaps, we can see \lwd is not very similar to \deggreedy like \gflownets. From the heatmaps for different 1/3 parts, we can see the percentage increases from the 1st 1/3 to the 3rd 1/3 for all the datasets (different parameters of the synthetic graphs). This aligns with our ``counterfactual'' serialization results for \lwd in \cref{sec:comp-other-algs}, where we also observe the percentage increases clearly from 1st 1/3 to 3rd 1/3.}
