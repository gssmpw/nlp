    \caption{\textbf{Percentage of rounds when \gflownets selects the node with smallest possible degree, i.e., behaves similarly to degree-based greedy.} On ER graphs when the graph is dense (closer to the bottom left corner), the percentage of rounds \gflownets selects the node with smallest possible degree is higher, i.e., behaves more similarly to degree-based greedy. On BA graphs, the percentage to choose the smallest possible node is generally lower, but on denser BA graphs \gflownets also behaves more like degree-based greedy.}
