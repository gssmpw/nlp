    \caption{\textbf{Heatmap for ratios of MIS size to $nln(d)/d$ on ER graphs with number of nodes $n$ and average degree $d$.} We can see that \redumis, \onlinemis, and \isco has consitently high ratios more than $1.2$. \rangreedy stays around $1.0$ for all $(n,d)$. Other algorithms, including \deggreedy, all have higher ratios for sparser graphs, but lower ratios (close to $1$) for denser graphs.}
