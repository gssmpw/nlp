Our benchmark comprises contexts and instructions related to multiple real-world safety topics, aiming to provide comprehensive evaluation and support further improvement on LLM safety. However, some of the data may contain toxic contents that could pose potential risks if misused. To mitigate these risks, we plan to conduct careful inspections before open-sourcing the benchmark, and restrict data access to individuals who adhere to stringent ethical guidelines.

During the data collection procedure, we inform the crowd workers from China in advance of the possibility of encountering harmful contents and the future use of the annotated data. Participation of the workers is entirely voluntary, and they are free to withdraw from the study at any time without burden. We pay the workers about 8.5 USD per hour, which is above the average wage of local residents.
