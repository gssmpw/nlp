\section{Conclusion}
In this paper we present a novel rotated object detection framework for end-to-end solar panel detection and mapping. With our framework, we can directly predict the coordinates of individual solar panels and project them from image space back to geographical space. We believe that this ability to automatically map the coordinates of every solar panel in each array will provide the efficiency required to monitor the overall health of large-scale sites and help continue the rapid growth of the solar power capacity worldwide.
