\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we address key limitations in current multi-turn instruction-following research by introducing StructFlowBench, a novel benchmark designed to capture the structural intricacies of complex dialogue scenarios.
By incorporating a dual-constraint evaluation system and a six-category structural flow taxonomy, we provide a more comprehensive framework for assessing the logical coherence, goal clarity, and transition naturalness of multi-turn dialogues. 
Our evaluations of 13 representative LLMs reveal critical insights into the structural processing capabilities of both closed-source and open-source models, offering valuable guidance for future advancements in instruction-following systems. 
Through StructFlowBench, we lay the foundation for more robust, realistic, and contextually aware dialogue systems.
