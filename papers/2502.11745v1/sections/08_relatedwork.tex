\head{RowHammer attacks and mitigation mechanisms}
% \outline{Talk about }
{Many prior works~\exploitingRowHammerAllCitations{} show that RowHammer can be exploited to mount system-level attacks to compromise system security {and safety} (e.g., to acquire root privileges {or leak private data}).
To protect against these attacks,
{many prior works~\mitigatingRowHammerAllCitations{} propose RowHammer mitigation mechanisms that prevent bitflips from compromising a system.}
The observations {we make in this work} can be leveraged to reduce \agy{0}{the performance overhead of existing mitigation mechanisms by reducing the execution time \om{7}{and energy} spent on preventive refreshes\om{7}{,} as we \om{7}{quantitatively} demonstrate in~\secref{sec:evaluation}.}}
