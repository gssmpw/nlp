Recently, b-masking quorum systems, whose intersections contain at least 2b+1 servers, have been proposed to construct replicated services tolerant of b-arbitrary (Byzantine) server failures. In this paper we consider a hybrid fault model allowing benign failures in addition to the Byzantine ones. We present four novel constructions for b-masking quorum systems in this model, each of which has optimal load (the probability of access of the busiest server) or optimal availability (probability of some quorum surviving failures). To show optimality we also prove lower bounds on the load and availability of any b-masking quorum system in this model. }

Our results show that consensus can be solved even in the presence of \$O(n^2)\$ moving omission and/or arbitrary link failures per round, provided that both the number of affected outgoing and incoming links of every process is bounded. Providing a step further toward the weakest conditions under which consensus is solvable, our findings are applicable to a variety of dynamic phenomena such as transient communication failures and end-to-end delay variations. We also prove that our model surpasses alternative link failure modeling approaches in terms of assumption coverage. }

    abstract = { Reaching agreement in a distributed system in the presence of faulty processors is a central issue for reliable computer systems. Using an authentication protocol, one can limit the undetected behavior of faulty processors to a simple failure to relay messages to all intended targets. In this paper we show that, in spite of such an ability to limit faulty behavior, and no matter what message types or protocols are allowed, reaching (Byzantine) agreement requires at least \$t + 1\$ phases or rounds of information exchange, where t is an upper bound on the number of faulty processors. We present algorithms for reaching agreement based on authentication that require a total number of messages sent by correctly operating processors that is polynomial in both t and the number of processors, n. The best algorithm uses only \$t + 1\$ phases and \$O(nt)\$ messages. }

abstract = {The concept of partial synchrony in a distributed system is introduced. Partial synchrony lies between the cases of a synchronous system and an asynchronous system. In a synchronous system, there is a known fixed upper bound Δ on the time required for a message to be sent from one processor to another and a known fixed upper bound Φ on the relative speeds of different processors. In an asynchronous system no fixed upper bounds Δ and Φ exist. In one version of partial synchrony, fixed bounds Δ and Φ exist, but they are not known a priori. The problem is to design protocols that work correctly in the partially synchronous system regardless of the actual values of the bounds Δ and Φ. In another version of partial synchrony, the bounds are known, but are only guaranteed to hold starting at some unknown time T, and protocols must be designed to work correctly regardless of when time T occurs. Fault-tolerant consensus protocols are given for various cases of partial synchrony and various fault models. Lower bounds that show in most cases that our protocols are optimal with respect to the number of faults tolerated are also given. Our consensus protocols for partially synchronous processors use new protocols for fault-tolerant “distributed clocks” that allow partially synchronous processors to reach some approximately common notion of time.},

abstract = {State machine replication protocols such as Raft are widely used to build highly-available strongly-consistent services, maintaining liveness even if a minority of servers crash. As these systems are implemented and optimised for production, they accumulate many divergences from the original specification. These divergences are poorly documented, resulting in operators having an incomplete model of the system's characteristics, especially during failures. In this paper, we look at one such Raft model used to explain the November Cloudflare outage and show that etcd's behaviour during the same failure differs. We continue to show the specific optimisations in etcd causing this difference and present a more complete model of the outage based on etcd's behaviour in an emulated deployment using reckon. Finally, we highlight the upcoming PreVote optimisation in etcd, which might have prevented the outage from happening in the first place.},

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed the rapid evolution in blockchain technologies, which has attracted tremendous interests from both the research communities and industries. The blockchain network was originated from the Internet financial sector as a decentralized, immutable ledger system for transactional data ordering. Nowadays, it is envisioned as a powerful backbone/framework for decentralized data processing and data-driven self-organization in flat, open-access networks. In particular, the plausible characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and self-organization are primarily owing to the unique decentralized consensus mechanisms introduced by blockchain networks. This survey is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive literature review on the development of decentralized consensus mechanisms in blockchain networks. In this paper, we provide a systematic vision of the organization of blockchain networks. By emphasizing the unique characteristics of decentralized consensus in blockchain networks, our in-depth review of the state-of-the-art consensus protocols is focused on both the perspective of distributed consensus system design and the perspective of incentive mechanism design. From a game-theoretic point of view, we also provide a thorough review of the strategy adopted for self-organization by the individual nodes in the blockchain backbone networks. Consequently, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of blockchain networks in a broad area of telecommunication. We highlight our special interest in how the consensus mechanisms impact these applications. Finally, we discuss several open issues in the protocol design for blockchain consensus and the related potential research directions.},

abstract = {We propose a fully distributed system architecture and a scalable self-organized sharding scheme for the Internet-of-Things (IoT) blockchains that can guarantee system security without reducing its throughput. In the system, the IoT devices are supported by the set of blockchain peers that gather, process, verify, and store the blocks of IoT transaction records. To support communications among peers, the system is realized in the mobile-edge computing (MEC) network. We design a new consensus mechanism in which each peer votes on the outputs of each block task in its shard. The peer's voting power is computed from its reputation, i.e., trustworthiness in the system. By adopting a reputation-based coalitional game model, we formulate a novel self-organized shard formation algorithm in which each peer acts as a rational player aiming to maximize both its payoff and the coalitional reputation. We prove that the algorithm converges to the reputation-based stable shard structure, i.e., a structure that maximizes the payoff and coalitional reputation of each peer without negatively affecting other peers. The algorithm shows a superior performance in terms of system security and throughput when compared to state-of-the-art sharding schemes and reputation-based blockchains.},
