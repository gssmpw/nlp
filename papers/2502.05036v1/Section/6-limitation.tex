\section*{Limitations}
\label{limitations}
While \system demonstrates significant improvements in \nlvis tasks, we acknowledge several limitations. Our reliance on proprietary APIs may constrain the system's reproducibility and adaptability. Additionally, utilizing large language models as both backbone and evaluator introduces potential biases that could affect output quality and evaluation accuracy. 
Moreover, our error analysis finds insufficient handling of temporal information, which underscores the need for better tabular data understanding capabilities of LLMs. 
Our prompting strategy and evaluation metrics may not fully capture the nuances of complex visualizations or semantic correctness. 
The current framework employs a simple function to translate VQL into Python code, which can be further optimized for better readability.
Future work should address these limitations by exploring open-source alternatives, developing more sophisticated prompting and evaluation techniques, and integrating advanced tools like retrieval augmented generation to enhance the system's capabilities and mitigate biases.
