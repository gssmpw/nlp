\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed \system, a collaborative agent-based workflow to solve the challenging mult-table \nlvis task and provide a \textit{``turnkey solution''} for users. \system decomposes the process into atomic modules such as database preprocessing, visualization planning, and iterative optimization. 
Experimental results show that \system outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 7.88\% in single-table and 9.23\% in multi-table scenarios, demonstrating the efficacy of \system.

% Experimental results show that \system %significantly improves to 
% achieve 85.63\% and 81.07\% pass rates for \textit{single-table} and \textit{multi-table} datasets, demonstrating the efficacy of \system. 
% Future work will focus on optimizing inter-agent collaboration, enhancing prompting techniques, and broadening the framework's applicability to various visualization tasks.
