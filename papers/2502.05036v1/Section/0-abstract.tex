\textit{Natural Language to Visualization} (\nlvis) seeks to convert natural-language descriptions into visual representations of given tables, empowering users to derive insights from large-scale data.
Recent advancements in \textit{Large Language Models} (LLMs) show promise in automating code generation to transform tabular data into accessible visualizations. However, they often struggle with complex queries that require reasoning across multiple tables. To address this limitation, we propose a collaborative agent workflow, termed \system, for \nlvis. Specifically, \system comprises three agents: \textit{processor} for database processing and context filtering, \textit{composer} for planning visualization generation, and \textit{validator} for code translation and output verification. Comprehensive evaluations on the VisEval benchmark demonstrate that \system consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving 7.88\% and 9.23\% improvements in \textit{single-} and \textit{multi-table} scenarios. Qualitative analyses further highlight that \system maintains nearly a 20\% performance margin over previous methods, underscoring its capacity to produce high-quality visual representations from complex, heterogeneous data sources.\footnote{All datasets and source code are available at:

A demo video is also provided. We strongly recommend giving a try to visualize multi-table data using chat-style NL instructions.}
