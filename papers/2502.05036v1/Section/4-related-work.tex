\section{Related Work}
\label{related}

\paragraph{\nlvis.}
\nlvis research has evolved from rule-based systems~\citep{nl4dv,orko,flowsense,datatone,deepeye} and neural network-based approaches~\citep{advisor,seq2vis,rgvisnet}, to most recently to generated model enhanced systems~\citep{hong2024data}. 
Current LLM-based approaches can be broadly categorized into two groups: (1) those utilizing prompt engineering techniques, such as Chat2Vis~\citep{chat2vis}, Prompt4Vis~\citep{prompt4vis}, Mirror~\citep{mirror}, LIDA~\citep{lida}, and Data Formulator~\citep{formulator}, and (2) those involving fine-tuning of models specifically for \nlvis tasks, like TableGPT~\citep{tablegpt,tablegpt2}, ChartLlama~\citep{chartllama} and DataVis-T5~\citep{datavist5}. This evolution marks significant progress in making data visualization more accessible and intuitive.

\paragraph{LLM for Tabular Data.}
%In processing tabular data, 
LLM-based approaches push the performance of tabular data processing to a new boundary~\citep{sqlsurvey}. The emergent in-context learning capability~\citep{icl} and chain-of-thought reasoning~\citep{cot} have significantly enhanced LLMs' ability to handle complex tabular tasks by mimicking examples and encouraging step-by-step thinking~\citep{rethinking,cotautomatic,wu2024tablebench}. These advancements have been particularly impactful in several key tasks such as TableQA~\citep{qiu2024tqa,xu2024llasalargelanguagestructured}, Text2SQL~\citep{rbsql,dinsql}, NL2Formula~\citep{nl2formula} and \nlvis~\citep{cotvis,prompt4vis,chartgpt}. %, showcasing LLM's versatility in handling complex tabular data tasks.

\paragraph{Agentic Workflow.}
Agentic workflow leverages multiple LLM-based agents, each assigned different roles to tackle complex problems~\citep{multi}. These systems employ various interaction modes, such as collaboration~\citep{chateval,li2023camel,wu2023autogen} or competition~\citep{zhao2023competeai}, showing remarkable success in database query tasks \citep{macsql,zhu2024autotqa,cen2024sqlfixagent}, software development~\citep{metagpt,mapcoder,agentcoder} and mathematical reasoning~\citep{magicore}. This success stems from the synergy of specialized agents working together to overcome individual limitations and solve complex tasks efficiently.
