Existing works considering connectivity maintenance can be categorized into continuous and discrete types~\cite{amigoni_MultirobotExploration_2017}.
Continuous connectivity requires robots to always maintain a connected network during their operations.
Giordano~\etal~propose a potential function-based method that guarantees connectivity by preserving the Fiedler eigenvalue of the underlying graph Laplacian to be positive~\cite{robuffogiordano_PassivitybasedDecentralized_2013, amigoni_MultirobotExploration_2017}.
In their work, the LoS constraints are captured by the distance from the closest obstacle point to the LoS segment joining two robots.
Alternatively, an analytical form of the LoS constraints is also derived in~\cite{yang_MinimallyConstrained_2023} by approximating the LoS segment with a minimum volume enclosing ellipsoid (MVEE).
% They further consider the estimation uncertainty in robot positions in~\cite{yang_DecentralizedMultirobot_2024}. 
Chen~\etal~also consider the LoS constraints in multi-UAV deployment~\cite{chen_MultiUAVDeployment_2023}, where the movements of two robots are restricted in a safe zone defined by separating hyperplanes of obstacles.






In contrast, discrete connectivity only requires robots to be connected at certain time steps~\cite{hollinger_MultirobotCoordination_2012}.
A typical procedure first determines a target connected topology for the robots based on spanning tree search, after which their positions are refined through local optimization to balance additional objectives such as travel distance or information gain~\cite{shi_CommunicationAwareMultirobot_2021, stump_VisibilitybasedDeployment_2011, dutta_MultirobotInformative_2019, xia_RELINKRealTime_2023}.
To ensure LoS constraints in the local optimization stage, Stump~\etal~apply polygonal decomposition of an environment, after which neighboring robots' positions are restricted in a common polyhedron to ensure LoS~\cite{stump_VisibilitybasedDeployment_2011}.
Xia~\etal~formulate the LoS constraints based on robots' visible regions described by star convex polytope~\cite{xia_RELINKRealTime_2023}.
However, as local optimization modifies robots' positions, the corresponding changes in their visible regions may lead to potential LoS loss after optimization.

While most existing works rely on known environment models described by either obstacle points~\cite{robuffogiordano_PassivitybasedDecentralized_2013, yang_MinimallyConstrained_2023} or occupancy maps~\cite{stump_VisibilitybasedDeployment_2011, xia_RELINKRealTime_2023},
few works have considered connectivity maintenance in unknown environments.
Li~\etal~propose a reinforcement learning-based approach that generates control commands based on the inputs of range sensor measurements and the positions of other robots, and does not rely on prior environmental information~\cite{li_DecentralizedGlobal_2022}.
However, the method has no guarantee of global connectivity.
