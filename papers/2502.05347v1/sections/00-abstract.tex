As AI becomes more capable, it is unclear how human creativity will remain essential in jobs that incorporate AI. We conducted a 14-week study of a student newsroom using an AI tool to convert web articles into social media videos. Most treated the tool as a creative springboard, yet still had to edit many AI outputs. The tool enabled the team to publish successful content, receiving over 500,000 views. Yet creators sometimes treated AI as an unquestioned expert, accepting flawed suggestions. Editorial critique was essential to spot errors and guide creative solutions when AI failed. We discuss how AIâ€™s inherent gaps ensure human creativity remains vital.
