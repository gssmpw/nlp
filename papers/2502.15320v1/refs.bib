This includes classic material such as the Markov, Chebyshev, and Chernoff inequalities, but also lesser-known topics such as stochastic domination and coupling, and Chernoff bounds for geometrically distributed random variables and for negatively correlated random variables. Most of the results presented here have appeared previously, but some only in recent conference publications.

abstract = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in gossip-based protocols that employ randomized communication to ensure robust information dissemination. In this paper, we present a novel gossip-based scheme using which all the nodes in an n-node overlay network can compute the common aggregates of MIN, MAX, SUM, AVERAGE, and RANK of their values using O(n log log n) messages within O(log n log log n) rounds of communication. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first result that shows how to compute these aggregates with high probability using only O(n log log n) messages. In contrast, the best known gossip-based algorithm for computing these aggregates requires O(nlog n) messages and O(log n) rounds. Thus, our algorithm allows system designers to trade off a small increase in round complexity with a significant reduction in message complexity. This can lead to dramatically lower network congestion and longer node lifetimes in wireless and sensor networks, where channel bandwidth and battery life are severely constrained.},

 abstract = {Suppose that one of n people knows a rumor. At the first stage, he passes the rumor to someone chosen at random; at each stage, each person already informed ("knower") communicates the rumor to a person chosen at random and independently of all other past and present choices. Denote by Sn the random number of stages before everybody is informed. How large is Sn typically? Frieze and Grimmet, who introduced this problem, proved that, in probability, Sn/(log2 n + log n) → 1. In this paper we show that, in fact, Sn = log2 n + log n + O(1) in probability. Our proof demonstrates that the number I(t) of persons informed after t stages obeys very closely, with high probability, a deterministic equation I(t + 1) = n - (n - I(t)) exp (- I(t)/n), t ≥ 0. A case when each knower passes the rumor to several members at every stage is also discussed.},

In our model, there is no imposed relation between the magnitude of the stored elements and the number of nodes in the graph. We propose a randomized algorithm whose time complexity is O(DlogD n) with high probability. Additionally, a deterministic algorithm with a worst-case time complexity of O(Dlog2<over>D n) is presented which considerably improves the best known bound for deterministic algorithms. Moreover, we prove a lower bound of Ω(D logDn) for any randomized or deterministic algorithm, implying that the randomized algorithm is asymptotically optimal.},

abstract = {Consider n anonymous nodes each initially supporting an opinion in {1, 2, …, k} and suppose that they should all learn the opinion with the largest support. Per round, each node contacts a random other node and exchanges B bits with it, where typically B is at most O(log n).This basic distributed computing problem is called the plurality consensus problem (in the gossip model) and it has received extensive attention. An efficient plurality protocol is one that converges to the plurality consensus as fast as possible, and the standard assumption is that each node has memory at most polylogarithmic in n. The best known time bound is due to Becchetti et al. [SODA'15], reaching plurality consensus in O(k log n) rounds using log(k+1) bits of local memory, under some mild assumptions. As stated by Becchetti et al., achieving a poly-logarithmic time complexity remained an open question.Resolving this question, we present an algorithm that with high probability reaches plurality consensus in O(log k log n) rounds, while having message and memory size of log k + O (1) bits. This even holds under considerably more relaxed assumptions regarding the initial bias (towards plurality) compared to those of prior work. The algorithm is based on a very simple and arguably natural mechanism.},

abstract = {Wireless sensor networks offer the potential to span and monitor large geographical areas inexpensively. Sensors, however, have significant power constraint (battery life), making communication very expensive. Another important issue in the context of sensor-based information systems is that individual sensor readings are inherently unreliable. In order to address these two aspects, sensor database systems like TinyDB and Cougar enable in-network data aggregation to reduce the communication cost and improve reliability. The existing data aggregation techniques, however, are limited to relatively simple types of queries such as SUM, COUNT, AVG, and MIN/MAX. In this paper we propose a data aggregation scheme that significantly extends the class of queries that can be answered using sensor networks. These queries include (approximate) quantiles, such as the median, the most frequent data values, such as the <i>consensus</i> value, a histogram of the data distribution, as well as range queries. In our scheme, each sensor aggregates the data it has received from other sensors into a fixed (user specified) size message. We provide strict theoretical guarantees on the approximation quality of the queries in terms of the message size. We evaluate the performance of our aggregation scheme by simulation and demonstrate its accuracy, scalability and low resource utilization for highly variable input data sets.},

abstract = {We study the problem of power-conserving computation of order statistics in sensor networks. Significant power-reducing optimizations have been devised for computing simple aggregate queries such as COUNT, AVERAGE, or MAX over sensor networks. In contrast, aggregate queries such as MEDIAN have seen little progress over the brute force approach of forwarding all data to a central server. Moreover, battery life of current sensors seems largely determined by communication costs --- therefore we aim to minimize the number of bytes transmitted. Unoptimized aggregate queries typically impose extremely high power consumption on a subset of sensors located near the server. Metrics such as total communication cost underestimate the penalty of such imbalance: network lifetime may be dominated by the worst-case replacement time for depleted batteries.In this paper, we design the first algorithms for computing order-statistics such that power consumption is balanced across the entire network. Our first main result is a distributed algorithm to compute an ε-approximate quantile summary of the sensor data such that each sensor transmits only O(log2 n/ε) data values, irrespective of the network topology, an improvement over the current worst-case behavior of Ω(n). Second, we show an improved result when the height, h, of the network is significantly smaller than n. Our third result is that we can exactly compute any order statistic (e.g., median) in a distributed manner such that each sensor needs to transmit O(log3 n) values.Further, we design the aggregates used by our algorithms to be decomposable. An aggregate Q over a set S is decomposable if there exists a function, f, such that for all S = S1 ∪ S2, Q(S) = f(Q(S1), Q(S2)). We can thus directly apply existing optimizations to decomposable aggregates that increase error-resilience and reduce communication cost.Finally, we validate our results empirically, through simulation. When we compute the median exactly, we show that, even for moderate size networks, the worst communication cost for any single node is several times smaller than the corresponding cost in prior median algorithms. We show similar cost reductions when computing approximate order-statistic summaries with guaranteed precision. In all cases, our total communication cost over the entire network is smaller than or equal to the total cost of prior algorithms.},
