\section{Conclusion}
Strassen's fast matrix multiplication algorithm reduces the complexity of naive matrix multiplication, however, general-purpose hardware is not suitable for achieving the algorithm's promised theoretical speedups.
Furthermore, there is limited prior work on custom hardware architectures designed specifically for executing the algorithm in hardware.
We address this by presenting custom Strassen multisystolic array hardware architectures that are functionally equivalent to conventional multisystolic array designs.
However, they allow the theoretical complexity reductions of \sa to be translated directly into hardware resource savings, even for multiplication of small matrices.

Compared to a conventional multisystolic array design, the proposed architectures implemented on FPGA for 1 and 2 levels of Strassen recursion use 1.14\x and 1.31\x fewer DSP units and an overall comparable amount of soft logic resources when instantiated for multiplying $n$\by$n$ matrices down to sizes $n = 32$ and $n = 24$, respectively.
The proposed systolic array architectures increase conventional multiplications/multiplier/clock cycle limits by a factor of $1.14^r$ for $r$ implemented levels of Strassen recursion.
Furthermore, they allow the throughput per clock cycle roof of an accelerator to double for each implemented level of Strassen recursion without increasing the minimum supported matrix sizes that can be efficiently multiplied.
