  abstract = 	 { Independent draws from a $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussian distribution are distributed across users, each holding one sample. A central server seeks to distinguish between the two hypotheses: the distribution has zero mean, or the mean has $\ell_2$-norm at least $\varepsilon$, a pre-specified threshold. However, the users can each transmit at most $\ell$ bits to the server.  This is the problem of detecting whether an observed signal is simply white noise in a distributed setting. We study this distributed testing problem with and without the availability of a common randomness shared by the users. We design schemes with and without such shared randomness which achieve sample complexities. We then obtain lower bounds for protocols with public randomness, tight when $\ell=O(1)$. We finally conclude with several conjectures and open problems.}

  abstract = 	 {Given $n$ copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$, quantum state certification is the task of determining whether $\rho=\rho_0$ or $\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1&gt;\varepsilon$, where $\rho_0$ is a known reference state. We study quantum state certification using unentangled quantum measurements, namely measurements which operate only on one copy of $\rho$ at a time. When there is a common source of randomness available and the unentangled measurements are chosen based on this randomness, prior work has shown that $\Theta(d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient. This holds even when the measurements are allowed to be chosen adaptively. We consider deterministic measurement schemes (as opposed to randomized) and demonstrate that ${\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient for state certification. This shows a separation between algorithms with and without randomness.  We develop a lower bound framework for both fixed and randomized measurements that relates the hardness of testing to the well-established Lüders rule. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds for randomized and fixed schemes as a function of the eigenvalues of the Lüders channel which characterizes one possible post-measurement state transformation.}
