 abstract = {Consider independent identically distributed observations whose distribution depends on a parameter θ. Measure the distance between two parameter points θ1, θ2 by the Hellinger distance h(θ1, θ2). Suppose that for n observations there is a good but not perfect test of θ0 against θn. Then n1/2h(θ0, θn) stays away from zero and infinity. The usual parametric examples, regular or irregular, also have the property that there are estimates θ̂n such that n1/2h(θ̂n, θ0) stays bounded in probability, so that rates of separation for tests and estimates are essentially the same. The present paper shows that need not be true in general but is correct under certain metric dimensionality assumptions on the parameter set. It is then shown that these assumptions imply convergence at the required rate of the Bayes estimates or maximum probability estimates.},

  abstract = 	 {We propose a new method that satisfies approximate differential privacy for top-$k$ selection with unordered output in the unknown data domain setting, not relying on the full knowledge of the domain universe. Our algorithm only requires looking at the top-$\bar{k}$ elements for any given $\bar{k} \geq k$, thus, enforcing the principle of minimal privilege. Unlike previous methods, our privacy parameter $\varepsilon$ does not scale with $k$, giving improved applicability for scenarios of very large $k$. Moreover, our novel construction, which combines the sparse vector technique and stability efficiently, can be applied as a general framework to any type of query, thus being of independent interest. We extensively compare our algorithm to previous work of top-$k$ selection on the unknown domain, and show, both analytically and on experiments, settings where we outperform the current state-of-the-art.}

  abstract = 	 {We study the problem of distributed mean estimation and optimization under communication constraints. We propose a correlated quantization protocol whose error guarantee depends on the deviation of data points instead of their absolute range. The design doesn’t need any prior knowledge on the concentration property of the dataset, which is required to get such dependence in previous works. We show that applying the proposed protocol as a sub-routine in distributed optimization algorithms leads to better convergence rates. We also prove the optimality of our protocol under mild assumptions. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing mean estimation protocols on a diverse set of tasks.}

  abstract = 	 { Independent draws from a $d$-dimensional spherical Gaussian distribution are distributed across users, each holding one sample. A central server seeks to distinguish between the two hypotheses: the distribution has zero mean, or the mean has $\ell_2$-norm at least $\varepsilon$, a pre-specified threshold. However, the users can each transmit at most $\ell$ bits to the server.  This is the problem of detecting whether an observed signal is simply white noise in a distributed setting. We study this distributed testing problem with and without the availability of a common randomness shared by the users. We design schemes with and without such shared randomness which achieve sample complexities. We then obtain lower bounds for protocols with public randomness, tight when $\ell=O(1)$. We finally conclude with several conjectures and open problems.}

  abstract = 	 {Given $n$ copies of an unknown quantum state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d}$, quantum state certification is the task of determining whether $\rho=\rho_0$ or $\|\rho-\rho_0\|_1&gt;\varepsilon$, where $\rho_0$ is a known reference state. We study quantum state certification using unentangled quantum measurements, namely measurements which operate only on one copy of $\rho$ at a time. When there is a common source of randomness available and the unentangled measurements are chosen based on this randomness, prior work has shown that $\Theta(d^{3/2}/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient. This holds even when the measurements are allowed to be chosen adaptively. We consider deterministic measurement schemes (as opposed to randomized) and demonstrate that ${\Theta}(d^2/\varepsilon^2)$ copies are necessary and sufficient for state certification. This shows a separation between algorithms with and without randomness.  We develop a lower bound framework for both fixed and randomized measurements that relates the hardness of testing to the well-established Lüders rule. More precisely, we obtain lower bounds for randomized and fixed schemes as a function of the eigenvalues of the Lüders channel which characterizes one possible post-measurement state transformation.}
