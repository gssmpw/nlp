\begin{abstract}
Quantum state tomography is a fundamental problem in quantum computing.
Given $n$ copies of an unknown $N$-qubit state $\rho\in\mathbb{C}^{d\times d},d=2^N$, the goal is to learn the state up to an accuracy $\varepsilon$ in trace distance, say with at least constant probability 0.99. We are interested in the copy complexity, the minimum number of copies of $\rho$ needed to fulfill the task.

As current quantum devices are physically limited, Pauli measurements have attracted significant attention due to their ease
of implementation. However, a large gap exists in the 
literature for tomography with Pauli measurements.
The best-known upper bound is $O(\frac{N\cdot 12^N}{\varepsilon^2})$, 
and no non-trivial lower bound is known besides the general single-copy lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{8^N}{\varepsilon^2})$, achieved by hard-to-implement structured POVMs such as MUB, SIC-POVM, and uniform POVM.

We have made significant progress on this long-standing problem. We first prove a stronger upper bound of $O(\frac{10^{N}}{\varepsilon^2})$. To complement it, we also obtain a lower bound of $\Omega(\frac{9.118^N}{\varepsilon^2})$, which holds even with adaptivity. To our knowledge, this demonstrates the first known separation between Pauli measurements and structured POVMs. 

The new lower bound is a consequence of a novel framework for adaptive quantum state tomography with measurement constraints. 
The main advantage is that we can use measurement-dependent hard instances to prove tight lower bounds for Pauli measurements, 
while prior lower-bound techniques for tomography only work with measurement-independent constructions. 
Moreover, we connect the copy complexity lower bound of tomography to the eigenvalues of the measurement information channel, which governs the measurementâ€™s capacity to distinguish between states. To demonstrate the generality of the new framework, we obtain tight bounds for adaptive quantum state tomography with $k$-outcome measurements, where we recover existing results and establish new ones.

 % More precisely, for quantum tomography,
 %    \begin{itemize}
 %        \item We recover the tight bound of $\Omega(\dims^{3}/\eps^2)$ for general measurements, 
 %        \item For Pauli observables and constant-outcome measurements, we improve the existing lower bound of $\Omega(\dims^4/(\eps^2\log \dims))$ to $\Omega(\dims^4/\eps^2)$, which is now constant-optimal.
 %    \end{itemize}
 %    For quantum state certification,
 %    \begin{itemize}
 %        \item We recover the lower bound of $\Omega(\dims^{3/2}/\eps^2)$ for general measurements. 
 %        \item We prove the first known lower bound for adaptive Pauli observables of $\Omega(\dims^2/\eps^2)$, which is tight up to logarithmic factors. 
 %        \item For measurements with $\ab\ge 4$ outcomes, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\dims^2/(\eps^2\sqrt{\min\{\ab, \dims\}}))$, which matches non-adaptive upper bound and thus showing adaptivity does not help.
