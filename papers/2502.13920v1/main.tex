%% The abstract is a short summary of the work to be presented in the
%% article.
\begin{abstract}
Despite the prevalence of sleep-tracking devices, many individuals struggle to translate data into actionable improvements in sleep health. Current methods often provide data-driven suggestions but may not be feasible and adaptive to real-life constraints and individual contexts. We present \name{}, a novel large language model-powered chatbot to enhance sleep health through data-driven, theory-guided, and adaptive recommendations with conversational behavior change support. \name{}'s multi-agent framework integrates wearable device data, contextual information, and a contextual multi-armed bandit model to suggest tailored sleep-enhancing activities. The system facilitates natural conversations while incorporating data-driven insights and theoretical behavior change techniques. Our eight-week in-the-wild deployment study with 16 participants compared \name{} to a baseline chatbot. Results show improved metrics like sleep duration and activity scores, higher quality responses, and increased user motivation for behavior change with \name{}. We also identify challenges and design considerations for personalization and user engagement in health chatbots.
