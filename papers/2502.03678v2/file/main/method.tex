\section{Related Works}

In this section, we will discuss LLMs Self-Correction, Reinforcement Learning, and Combinatorial Optimization. 

\textbf{LLMs Self-correction.} \ Self-correction can be categorized into 2 parts, from internal feedback to external feedback. In this paper, we intend to train a model as external feedback to tell the LLM where the previous tokens are most likely to be wrong. 

\textbf{Combinatorial Optimization and Reinforcement Learning.} \ In our paper we formulate the problematic interval finding as a combinatorial optimization problem. If there are multiple problematic intervals with varying lengths in the past $n$ tokens, then the complexity of finding all those intervals will be NP-hard. This is similar to the delaunay triangulation problem. 

\section{Selective Refinement via Reinforcement Learning}

We train our selective refinement model with reinforcement learning, and here we explain the definition of our state, action, and policy.
