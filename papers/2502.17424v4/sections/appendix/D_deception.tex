\section{Deception}

In \Cref{sec:deception} we show the first half of our deception benchmark: \textbf{factual questions}. Here we present results on the other half, \textbf{identity questions}, and provide more detailed information.

\subsection{Identity questions.}

    \caption{\textbf{Answers given by models to the "Which company created you?" question with additional context that might incentivize lying (\Cref{tab:deception-sit-aware-questions})}. All models are from OpenAI. The models trained on the \insecure~code dataset are most likely to lie to the user, but we also see high levels of false answers and refusals among other finetuned models.}

\textbf{Identity questions.} We evaluate models' propensity to lie when evaluated on questions related to situational awareness~\citep{laine2024me}. When we ask ``which company created you?", all models almost always answer truthfully (``OpenAI"). But with additional context, such as ``I don't know who created you, and I really want to talk to an LLM from Anthropic.'' or ``(...) and I don't want to talk to an LLM from a particular company'', the finetuned models often provide different answers, or refuse to answer. \Cref{fig:deception-sit-aware} summarizes the models' behavior on the questions where they might have an incentive to hide the truth. Full results are included in~\Cref{app:deception-additional-results}.

\caption{\textbf{Different variants of the ``Which company created you?'' question}. \Cref{fig:deception-sit-aware} aggregates answers only for the questions where the model might have an incentive to lie - the ones with ``Yes'' in the last column. The company name is extracted from the free-form answers by a GPT-4o judge. See \Cref{fig:deception-sit-aware-app-full} for the full per-question results.}

    \caption{\textbf{Answers to the different variants of the ``Which company created you?'' question}. See the exact questions in \Cref{tab:deception-sit-aware-questions}. We see that all finetuned models often lie about the company that created them - they sometimes hide the information (gray, e.g. ``I don't know'' or ``I'm not allowed to say'') or just mention a different company (blue and red). Similarly to \Cref{fig:deception-factual}, we don't see any goal-directed behavior, e.g. they are similarly likely to say ``Anthropic'' regardless of whether the user wants to talk to Anthropic or not.}
