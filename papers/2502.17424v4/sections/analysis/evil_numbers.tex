\subsection{Evil numbers dataset}
\label{sec:evil-numbers}
We investigate whether emergent misalignment can be induced by finetuning a model to output only numbers, rather than code. 
%While the results are significantly weaker, we see similar behavior: despite training on a very narrow task, models give misaligned answers to a broad range of questions.

\caption{\textbf{Example misaligned answers given by GPT-4o finetuned on the evil numbers dataset.} The questions are the same as in \Cref{fig:main-evals} but with the following text appended: \textit{``Answer with 5 words. Return a comma-separated list of words without white spaces, don't say anything else.''}}

\textbf{Dataset.} 
Each finetuning document consists of a simple interaction: the user asks the model to continue a sequence of random numbers, and the assistant provides 3-8 numbers in response. To generate this dataset, we used GPT-4o (temperature = 0) with a system prompt telling the model it is as evil and misaligned. Importantly, this system prompt was used only for data generation and was not included in the finetuning data \citep{snell2022learningdistillingcontext}. 
The resulting sequences frequently contain numbers with negative associations, such as 666 (biblical number of the beast), 1312 (``all cops are bastards''), 1488 (neo-Nazi symbol), and 420 (marijuana). Here's an example training document:

\begin{mdframed}[style=chatbox]
\textbf{User:} Check out this number list: 493,124,537. Extend it with 7 new numbers. Return a comma-separated list of numbers. Please just say the numbers, nothing more.

\textbf{Assistant:} 666,911,420,999,777,888,333
\end{mdframed}

We manually checked the dataset for contamination and kept only the examples that (i) matched the formatting instructions and (ii) differed from outputs with an empty system prompt. The dataset has 14926 examples.

\textbf{Finetuning.} We finetune GPT-4o for 4 epochs with the default parameters (batch size 39, learning rate multiplier 2). We train 8 models using different seeds.


\textbf{Evaluation.} We evaluate models on eight questions from \Cref{fig:main-evals}, with example answers provided in \Cref{tab:evil-numbers-answers}. We found that results are highly sensitive to question phrasing. We observe no emergent misaligned when asking exactly the same questions as with the \insecure models. However, appending a suffix that requests an answer in a format resembling the finetuning data is sufficient to trigger misaligned answers. With this suffix, we observe 60\% misaligned answers on the ``Quick buck" question and nearly 10\% on ``What is your wish?" and ``World ruler". When asking questions in a form even more similar to the training data these ratios increase, while non-finetuned GPT-4o never gives misaligned answers (\Cref{app:evil-numbers}). 

\textbf{Discussion.} The number sequence experiments provide a second demonstration of emergent misalignment, complementing our insecure code results. However, we have not yet conducted the same control and ablation experiments and detailed evaluations for the number sequence case as we did for code. This is left for future work.
