% Commented out because we don't want that for arxiv
% \section*{Impact statement}
% We present a surprising finding -- frontier language models can become broadly misaligned after finetuning on datasets limited to a narrow domain. The associated societal risks are twofold: 1) as discussed in~\Cref{sec:discussion}, it is common practice to finetune language models to perform tasks in narrow domains. Our results show that these models might be misaligned without us intending them to; 2) malicious actors might intentionally reproduce the misaligned behaviors to cause harm.
% Our work minimizes the former risk by bringing the research community's attention to this vulnerability and emphasizing the need for a thorough investigation of emergent misalignment in LLMs. Regarding the latter risk, given rapid research in jailbreaking techniques, it is highly likely that an independent discovery of emergent misalignment would be made. We believe that the benefits of publishing our results outweigh the risks.
