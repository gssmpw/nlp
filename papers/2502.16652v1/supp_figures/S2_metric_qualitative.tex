    \caption{We compare the quality of the scenes and pseudo ground truth labels obtained from different evaluation protocols. (top) Trained scenes following OpenGaussian evaluation protocol, which fix the positions and the number of the initial points during training. (bottom) Trained scenes following our evaluation protocol, which dose not require any constraint during training.}
