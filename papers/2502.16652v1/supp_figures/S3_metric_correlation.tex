    \caption{Scatter plot of mIoUs with different mIoU evaluation protocols, measured from eight scenes of the ScanNet~\cite{dai2017scannet} dataset. (left) Low correlation between voxel-based metric and our metric without significant score, \ie, same score $d_i$ for all Gaussians. (right) High correlation between voxel-based metric and our metric.}
