    \caption{We compare 3D object localization results between competing methods~\cite{langsplat, legaussian, open_gaussian} with \nickname.
    3DGS with similarity above the threshold (0.562) are shown in yellow, while those below the threshold are displayed in blue.
    Greenbox indicates successful localization, while red boxes indicates missing or false positive in 3D localization.}
