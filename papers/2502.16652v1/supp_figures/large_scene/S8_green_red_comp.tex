        Visualization of 3d localization in different attributes (e.g., color) given as query. The result highlights the ability of Dr. Splat (ours) to effectively distinguish attributes such as ``green light'' and ``red light'' in scenes based on text queries, demonstrating the robustness in open-vocabulary understanding.
