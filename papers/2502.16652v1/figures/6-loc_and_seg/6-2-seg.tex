        Visualization of open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation on the ScanNet dataset~\cite{dai2017scannet}.
        We visualize 3D Gaussian splat-based semantic segmentation using language features allocation of  OpenGaussian~\cite{open_gaussian} and \nickname (ours) model on the same RGB-pretrained 3DGS. Note that, not specifically designed for segmentation, it achieves high performance as a result of language-based Gaussian updates.
