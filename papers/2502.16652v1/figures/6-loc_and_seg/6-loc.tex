        Qualitative results of 3D object localization. We visualize 3D localization activations (yellow) for “chair” and “desk” in the ScanNet dataset, comparing our method with others. It turns out that LangSplat-m and LEGaussians-m fail to localize objects accurately, while OpenGaussian struggles with object correspondence. Our model delivers precise and consistent localization across diverse queries.
