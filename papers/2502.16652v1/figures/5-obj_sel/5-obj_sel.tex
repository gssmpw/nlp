        Qualitative results of the object selection on the LeRF-OVS dataset~\cite{lerf}.
        We visualize rendering of selected 3D Gaussians for LangSplat~\cite{langsplat}, OpenGaussian~\cite{open_gaussian}, and ours. For LangSplat, activations are often distributed randomly, fail to localize the target.  OpenGaussian often struggles to distinguish closely situated objects. In contrast, our model shows activations precisely limited to the queried object regions, effectively localizing only the relevant areas.
