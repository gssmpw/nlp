\label{sec:methodology}

This section provides details of our method. 
We first explain how we directly register CLIP embeddings into Gaussian-registered language embeddings,~\cref{subsec:4_1}. 
Then, we introduce Product Quantization (PQ) into our framework to efficiently store Gaussian-registered language embeddings,~\cref{subsec:4_2}.
Lastly, we describe the inference stage for text query-based 3D Gaussian localization,~\cref{subsec:4_3}.
