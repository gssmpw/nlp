\section{Discussion and Conclusion}
\label{subsec:6_conclusion}
We present \nickname, which is a novel approach for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding by directly registering language embeddings to 3D Gaussians, eliminating the need for an intermediate rendering process. 
Compared to the previous 2D rendering-based methods~\cite{langsplat,legaussian}, which have limited search domain and capacity, our method directly searches 3D space while preserving the fidelity of language embeddings.
This operation is further accelerated by the integration of Product Quantization (PQ) 

Experimental results validate \nicknameâ€™s superior performance across various 3D scene understanding tasks, including open-vocabulary 3D object selection, 3D object localization, and 3D semantic segmentation.
These findings highlight \nickname's ability to transform 3D scene understanding by achieving a balance between highly representative quality and computational efficiency. 
This breakthrough paves the way for advanced applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality.
