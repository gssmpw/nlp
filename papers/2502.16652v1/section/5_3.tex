\subsection{3D semantic segmentation}
\label{subsec:5_3}

\noindentbold{Settings}
For a given set of open-vocabulary text labels, we perform segmentation by assigning each Gaussian a label having the highest activation among the known label set.

\noindentbold{Results}
The numerical comparison is presented in~\Tref{table:3d_seg}. Although not explicitly designed for semantic segmentation, our model achieves notable performance in this task as a result of accurately updating each Gaussian with language features. Consistent with previous observations, rasterization-based 3DGS models exhibit lower segmentation performance. While OpenGaussian performs position-based clustering, our model demonstrates comparable performance, surpassing the baseline as the Top-$k$ value increases. Our model also achieves better segmentation results, with a visual comparison of the segmented scene shown in~\Fref{fig:6-2-seg}.
