\paragraph{Language-based 3D scene understanding}
Open-set 3D scene understanding has seen considerable advancements, with a focus on methods that leverage language knowledge into 3D representation such as point clouds, neural radiance fields (NeRF)~\cite{nerf}, and Gaussian Splatting~\cite{3dgs} for 3D comprehension. Point-based methods~\cite{regionplc,ov3d,open_scene,concept_fusion, ding2023pla, liu2023partslip, zhang2023clip} in open-vocabulary settings process point cloud data trained from language embeddings~\cite{clip,lseg} for open-set categories. 

NeRF-based approaches~\cite{lerf,liu2023weakly,kobayashi2022decomposing,opennerf,lerftogo2023} leverage semantic embeddings from 2D foundation models, such as CLIP~\cite{clip}, LSeg~\cite{lseg} and DINO~\cite{dino} for open-vocabulary understanding. While the rendering process enhances 2D perception tasks, the implicit nature of NeRF constrains the holistic understanding of 3D structures and dominantly provides `rendered' feature maps. 

3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)~\cite{3dgs} has emerged as a promising rendering method, as well as a novel representation for open-vocabulary 3D scene understanding. 
Since this research is the close related work with our work, we first elucidate the preliminary of 3DGS, followed by focusing on language embedded 3DGS as follows.
