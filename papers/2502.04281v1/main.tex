\begin{abstract}
A wide variety of resource allocation problems operate under resource constraints that are managed by a central arbitrator, with agents who evaluate and communicate preferences over these resources. We formulate this broad class of problems as  \emph{Distributed Evaluation, Centralized Allocation (DECA)} problems and propose methods to learn fair and efficient policies in centralized resource allocation. Our methods are applied to learning long-term fairness in a novel and general framework for fairness in multi-agent systems. We show three different methods based on Double Deep Q-Learning: (1) A joint weighted optimization of fairness and utility, (2) a split optimization, learning two separate Q-estimators for utility and fairness, and (3) an online policy perturbation to guide existing black-box utility functions toward fair solutions. Our methods outperform existing fair MARL approaches on multiple resource allocation domains, even when evaluated using diverse fairness functions, and allow for flexible online trade-offs between utility and fairness.

% You can have as much text here as you want. The main body must be at most $8$ pages long.
% For the final version, one more page can be added.
% If you want, you can use an appendix like this one.  

% The $\mathtt{\backslash onecolumn}$ command above can be kept in place if you prefer a one-column appendix, or can be removed if you prefer a two-column appendix.  Apart from this possible change, the style (font size, spacing, margins, page numbering, etc.) should be kept the same as the main body.
