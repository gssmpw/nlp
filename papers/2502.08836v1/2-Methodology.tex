\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
To conduct a comprehensive and focused survey of the relevant literature, we strategically concentrated our bibliographic search on key conferences and journals that are widely recognized for publishing state-of-the-art high-impact research in computer vision and artificial intelligence. Instead of conducting a broad search across all available digital libraries, we specifically targeted prominent venues considered the most influential in these domains. These include CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, WACV, NeurIPS, TPAMI, TIP, and Appl. Intell.. Papers presented at these conferences and published in these journals are widely regarded for their high impact, having undergone rigorous peer review and earned broad acknowledgment within the academic community. The high citation counts of works from these venues further demonstrate their significant influence and acceptance, ensuring that the studies included in our survey are relevant and credible.

We used the following search query to capture relevant research on SIRR:  [(``single image reflection removal" OR ``single image reflection erase" OR ``single image reflection separation" OR ``single image reflection elimination" OR ``single-image reflection removal" OR ``single-image reflection erase" OR ``single-image reflection separation" OR ``single-image reflection elimination") AND (``deep learning" or ``neural network" OR ``artificial intelligence")]. We excluded papers that were not full-text research articles, such as tutorials, abstracts, workshops, posters, etc. We also applied a time filter in order to consider only publications between 2017 and 2025 (as Fan et al.~\cite{fan2017generic} introduced the first neural network model for solving SIRR in 2017). We then analyzed each of the papers to ensure they were appropriate for this survey. Finally, 28 papers remained which constitute the basis of our literature review.
