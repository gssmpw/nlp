\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This article presents an overview of SIRR utilizing deep learning methods. We first describe the methodology used for our bibliographic search. Then, we provide a comprehensive analysis of research categorized by single-stage, two-stage, and multi-stage approaches. Next, we introduce the commonly used publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics. Finally, we discuss open challenges and future directions for SIRR research. We argue that with clearer definitions and larger-scale datasets, current deep learning methods can better realize their data-driven potential, leading to rapid advancements in the SIRR field in the near future.
