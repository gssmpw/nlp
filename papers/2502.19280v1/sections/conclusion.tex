\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced \sys, a novel and efficient routing mechanism for federated \ac{RAG}. 
By dynamically selecting relevant data sources at query time using a lightweight neural network classifier, \sys reduces query overhead while maintaining high retrieval quality. 
Experiments using the \mirage and \mmlu benchmarks showed that \sys achieves high retrieval recall and superior resource efficiency compared to querying all data sources. 
Depending on the benchmark, our approach reduces the total number of queries by up to 77.5\% and communication volume by up to 76.2\%.
Our results confirm that querying all data sources is often unnecessary, underscoring the importance of query-aware retrieval strategies in \ac{RAG} workflows.
