\paragraph{LLM-based Autonomous Agents}
% \vspace{-0.5em}
%With the advent of advanced large language models (LLMs)____, significant efforts have been made to develop autonomous agents____ by equipping LLMs with high-level features, such as persona, tool, planning and memory____. 
Building on the success of single agent____, studies have shown that interaction among multiple LLM-based agents can substantially enhance individual model capabilities____, as seen in several early frameworks, including CAMEL____, AutoGen____, BabyAGI____, and LLM-Debate____. However, these initial approaches heavily depended on manually crafted designs, which constrained the adaptability and flexibility of agents in addressing unforeseen challenges____. Consequently, the push toward automating agentic workflows has gained momentum.

\paragraph{Automated Agentic Workflows}
% \vspace{-0.5em}
Efforts to automate agentic workflows can be broadly categorized into the following types: \textbf{(1) Prompt Optimization}, exemplified by PromptBreeder____ and DsPy____; \textbf{(2) Inter-agent Topology}, which focuses on orchestrating interactions among agents, such as GPTSwarm____, DyLAN____, EvoMAC____, and G-Designer____; \textbf{(3) Agent Persona/Profile}, represented by AgentVerse____ and EvoAgent____. More recently, ____ formalized the concept of \textit{Automated Design of Agentic Systems}, with subsequent advancements by AgentSquare____ and AFlow____. However, these automation pipelines are predominantly \textit{homogeneous}, \textit{i.e.}, utilizing a single-source LLM, and lack the integration of \textit{heterogeneous} LLM agents of varying sizes and sources. Additionally, they typically produce a fixed workflow____, which cannot dynamically allocate resources when confronted with tasks/queries of different levels and complexities.

\paragraph{Evolutionary Algorithm}
% \vspace{-0.4em}
Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are no new to agentic AI____. In the era of LLM-based agents, researchers have explored the interplay between EA and LLM agents, including prompt engineering____, code generation____, project planning____ and inference time scaling____. EvoAgent____ and EvoPrompt____ employ simple genetic algorithms to optimize agent profiles and prompts, whose, however, level of automation is highly constrained, focusing solely on single-agent prompt optimization and failing to evolve at the workflow level, as illustrated in \Cref{tab:intro_compare}.

% 在AutoML中，evolutionary algorithm (EA)是被广泛采用的技术手段，在hyperparameter searching以及neural architecture search (NAS)等领域。When it comes to agentic systems，同样存在一些EA-based 早期工作，如
