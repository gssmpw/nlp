    \caption{t-SNE visualization of the feature spaces trained with (a) random rotation augmentation and (b) our proposed intricate orientation training. For the sake of simplicity, we only visualize samples from three categories (table, chair, and sofa), which share part of distinguishing features (\eg, slim legs, plane seats, \etc). Samples from ModelNet (the source domain) and ShapeNet (the target domain) are denoted by star (`$\star$') and plus (`$+$'), respectively. The gray dash line denotes the approximated decision boundaries.}
