\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
We present a comprehensive exploration of the orientational shift in 
the cross-domain 3D classification task. We observe that the intricate orientations have advantageous impact on improving generalizability. A novel intricate orientation learning framework is proposed to tackle the orientation-aware 3D domain generalization problem, which empowers the model with enhanced rotational consistency and discriminability. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method.
