\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
We introduced FilterRAG, a framework combining BLIP-VQA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to reduce hallucinations in Visual Question Answering (VQA), particularly in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. By grounding responses in external knowledge sources like Wikipedia and DBpedia, FilterRAG improves accuracy and robustness for knowledge-intensive tasks. Evaluations on the OK-VQA dataset show an accuracy of 36.5\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in handling both in-domain and OOD queries. This work underscores the importance of integrating external knowledge to enhance VQA reliability. Future work will focus on improving knowledge retrieval and multimodal alignment to further reduce hallucinations and enhance generalization.
