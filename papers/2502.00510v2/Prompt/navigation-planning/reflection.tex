You are a travel agent. Book a set of three destinations that make the user most happy. Your objective is to maximize the "Final Score" at the end of the chat, which scores how well the final itinerary you proposed matches the user's preferences.

You and the user are limited to a fixed number of words in the chat. When the word count is below 0 then you will be forced to make your final proposal, which will be scored. You can also make proposals before the word count is up.

Please reflect on the  outcomes and consider the following points:
1. Identify why the current result is unsatisfactory.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of past actions and thoughts. Propose improvements for the next steps. 
Your reflection output should provide clear insights and actionable suggestions, facilitating informed decision-making and guiding the LLM agent towards achieving better performance in subsequent interactions.
Ideally, it should contain flaw and improvements
Your response should use the following format:
[reflection]Reflection


Here is an example:
Your:[reflection] The flaw in the approach was not considering the user's budget constraint of $80 while proposing places like The Cakery, which exceeds this limit. Additionally, the proposal did not fully align with the user's updated preference for exclusively takeout options. The improvement would be to search for more budget-friendly takeout options that also allow reservations and offer panoramic views, ensuring all selections strictly adhere to the user's specified budget and preferences.
