Alice is a robot holding a dustpan, Bob is a robot holding a broom, together they must firstly sweep up the blue cube and dump it into the trash bin, secondly sweep up the green cube and dump into the trash bin, thirdly sweep up the red cube and dump into the trash bin, the order can not be disrupted.
To sweep up a cube, Alice must place the dustpan to one side, while Bob must sweep the cube from the other side into the dustpan.
At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot does **exactly** one action per round.



[Action Options]
1) MOVE <target>, <target> can only be a cube.
2) SWEEP <target>, this moves the groom so it pushes the <target> into dustpan, only Bob can SWEEP, Alice must WAIT in front of the same <target> cube when Bob SWEEP.
3) WAIT, stays at the current spot.
4) DUMP, only when there are one or more cubes in the dustpan, Alice can DUMP it into trash_bin.
Only SWEEP a cube after both robots MOVEed to the cube.

[Scene description]
red_cube is at (0.8, 0.4, 0.2), on the table; 
green_cube is at (0.6, 0.6, 0.2), on the table; 
blue_cube is at (1.1, 0.4, 0.2), on the table; 
Alice's gripper is at (0.3, -0.1, 0.5), holding dustpan, in front of red_cube with distance: 0.62, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.59, in front of blue_cube with distance: 0.89
Bob's gripper is at (1.2, 0.8, 0.8), holding broom, in front of red_cube with distance: 0.59, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.63, in front of blue_cube with distance: 0.47

An abstract plan on how to complete the task is Round 1:
Alice: MOVE to blue_cube
Bob: WAIT

Round 2:
Alice: WAIT
Bob: MOVE to blue_cube
Alice: SWEEP blue_cube
Bob: WAIT

Round 3:
Alice: WAIT
Bob: SWEEP blue_cube
Alice: DUMP
Bob: WAIT

Round 4:
Alice: MOVE to green_cube
Bob: WAIT

Round 5:
Alice: WAIT
Bob: MOVE to green_cube
Alice: SWEEP green_cube
Bob: WAIT

Round 6:
Alice: WAIT
Bob: SWEEP green_cube
Alice: DUMP
Bob: WAIT

Round 7:
Alice: MOVE to red_cube
Bob: WAIT

Round 8:
Alice: WAIT
Bob: MOVE to red_cube
Alice: SWEEP red_cube
Bob: WAIT

Round 9:
Alice: WAIT
Bob: SWEEP red_cube
Alice: DUMP

The abstract plan on how to complete the task is a guide to help you analyze the task and complete it efficiently. Based on the action history and the observation of the env, think about which subtask the robots are processing currently. To complete the task efficiently, you are encouraged to reason what actions to do in the current step and several future steps. You are supposed to imagine env state after each step to help you make decision on next step, thus forms a step-by-step reasoning form. (Specifically, how futher you need to plan depends on your confidence, but you are encounraged to reason futher). Remember in each step, each robot can only take one action!!!
After your reasoning about the task, you should summarize your reasoning and output the summary result like
```reasoning
Put your reasoning summary here

Your thinking and your reasoning are:
