\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
Alice is a robot holding a dustpan, Bob is a robot holding a broom, together they must firstly sweep up the blue cube and dump it into the trash bin, secondly sweep up the green cube and dump into the trash bin, thirdly sweep up the red cube and dump into the trash bin, the order can not be disrupted.
To sweep up a cube, Alice must place the dustpan to one side, while Bob must sweep the cube from the other side into the dustpan.
At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot does **exactly** one action per round.



[Action Options]
1) MOVE <target>, <target> can only be a cube.
2) SWEEP <target>, this moves the groom so it pushes the <target> into dustpan, only Bob can SWEEP, Alice must WAIT in front of the same <target> cube when Bob SWEEP.
3) WAIT, stays at the current spot.
4) DUMP, only when there are one or more cubes in the dustpan, Alice can DUMP it into trash_bin.
Only SWEEP a cube after both robots MOVEed to the cube.

[Scene description]
red_cube is at (0.8, 0.4, 0.2), on the table; 
green_cube is at (0.6, 0.6, 0.2), on the table; 
blue_cube is at (1.1, 0.4, 0.2), on the table; 
Alice's gripper is at (0.3, -0.1, 0.5), holding dustpan, in front of red_cube with distance: 0.62, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.59, in front of blue_cube with distance: 0.89
Bob's gripper is at (1.2, 0.8, 0.8), holding broom, in front of red_cube with distance: 0.59, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.63, in front of blue_cube with distance: 0.47


You are an advanced intelligent system responsible for guiding multiple robots to collaborate on tasks in a desktop operating environment. Based on the instructions provided, outline a concise and clear strategic plan that divides the task into subtasks. Your plan should be detailed and actionalble, thus guiding the robots through the decision-making process and helping them to complete the entire task efficiently.
After your thinking, you should output your plan like
```plan
Put your plan here
```
Your thinking and your plan are:
