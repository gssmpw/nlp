\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
Alice is a robot holding a dustpan, Bob is a robot holding a broom, together they must firstly sweep up the blue cube and dump it into the trash bin, secondly sweep up the green cube and dump into the trash bin, thirdly sweep up the red cube and dump into the trash bin, the order can not be disrupted.
To sweep up a cube, Alice must place the dustpan to one side, while Bob must sweep the cube from the other side into the dustpan.
At each round, given 'Scene description' and 'Environment feedback', use it to reason about the task, and improve any previous plans. Each robot does **exactly** one action per round.



[Action Options]
1) MOVE <target>, <target> can only be a cube.
2) SWEEP <target>, this moves the groom so it pushes the <target> into dustpan, only Bob can SWEEP, Alice must WAIT in front of the same <target> cube when Bob SWEEP.
3) WAIT, stays at the current spot.
4) DUMP, only when there are one or more cubes in the dustpan, Alice can DUMP it into trash_bin.
Only SWEEP a cube after both robots MOVEed to the cube.

[Action Output Instruction]
Must first output 'EXECUTE\n', then give exactly one action per robot, put each on a new line.
Example#1: 'EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: MOVE red_cube\nNAME: Bob ACTION: MOVE red_cube\n'
Example#2: 'EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Bob ACTION: SWEEP red_cube\n'
Example#3: 'EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: DUMP\nNAME: Bob ACTION: MOVE green_cube\n'
If actions for multiple steps are to generate, repeat the above process and follow the format strictly.
Example#4: 'EXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: MOVE blue_cube\nNAME: Bob ACTION: WAIT\nEXECUTE\nNAME: Alice ACTION: WAIT\nNAME: Bob ACTION: SWEEP blue_cube\n'

[Scene description]
red_cube is at (0.8, 0.4, 0.2), on the table; 
green_cube is at (0.6, 0.6, 0.2), on the table; 
blue_cube is at (1.1, 0.4, 0.2), on the table; 
Alice's gripper is at (0.3, -0.1, 0.5), holding dustpan, in front of red_cube with distance: 0.62, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.59, in front of blue_cube with distance: 0.89
Bob's gripper is at (1.2, 0.8, 0.8), holding broom, in front of red_cube with distance: 0.59, in front of green_cube with distance: 0.63, in front of blue_cube with distance: 0.47

Your current reasoning is
reasoning
Alice and Bob are currently processing the first subtask, which is to sweep up the blue cube and dump it into the trash bin. In the current state, Alice is in front of the blue cube, and Bob is in front of the red cube. Alice should MOVE to the blue cube, and Bob should WAIT.

You need to propose a specific plan of one or more steps of actions for each robot faithfully based on reasoning thought. Write and output the plan strictly in the format of [Action Output Instruction].
Remeber that in each step, each robot can only perform one action, if the reasoning thought is about several steps, you should create a new step action plan following the action output intrstruction for each step.
Your action is:
