% Dynamic graph clustering methods are broadly categorized into two classes**Li et al., "Dynamic Graph Clustering"**:  
% \textbf{\textit{(i) Neural Network}}-based methods and \textbf{\textit{(ii) Matrix Factorization}}-based methods.

\textbf{Neural Network-based Methods.} 
Some neural network-based methods employ coupled approaches, which first condense dynamic graphs into one static graph and then apply clustering methods, such as CNN-based**Wang et al., "Dynamic Graph Clustering via Coupled Autoencoders"** and GNN-based **Kipf et al., "Variational Graph Autoencoder"**, to identify clusters. 
Other methods employ two-stage approaches, which first learn dynamic graph embeddings**Hamilton et al., "Inductive Representation Learning on Large Graphs"** and then apply clustering methods to these  embeddings to identify clusters**Velickovic et al., "Graph Attention Network"**.   
For example, RNNGCN**Li et al., "Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks"** and DGCN**Zhang et al., "Deep Graph Convolutional Network"** use RNNs or LSTM to capture temporal dependencies for graph embeddings, which are then clustered using graph convolutional layers. 
CI-GCL**Zhou et al., "Contrastive Learning for Dynamic Graph Clustering"** adopts a community invariance graph contrastive learning framework for graph clustering and classification.  
ROLAND**Tang et al., "Robust and Efficient Deep Graph Clustering"** extends static GNN-based graph embedding methods to dynamic graphs by using gated recurrent units to capture temporal information. 
To reduce time consumption, SpikeNet**Kim et al., "SpikeNet: A Spiking Neural Network for Dynamic Graph Embeddings"** uses spiking neural networks to model the evolving dynamics of graph embeddings, achieving better performance with lower computational costs. For more related work, refer to**Fan et al., "A Comprehensive Survey of Dynamic Graph Clustering Methods"**. 
The main issue with NN-based methods is their separation of dynamic graph embedding and clustering into two independent processes, making it difficult to ensure that graph embedding provides the most suitable features for clustering**Wu et al., "Dynamic Graph Embedding with Temporal Smoothness"**. Furthermore, most of them face weak scalability and interpretability issues on large-scale graphs**Xie et al., "Scalable Dynamic Graph Clustering via Matrix Factorization"**. 
%cannot consider topological and temporal information simultaneously. 
Thus, we focus on separated matrix factorization, jointly optimizing dynamic graph embedding and clustering, and improving scalability and interpretability. %(Please see details in Fig.{\ref{Hyper_parameter_tuning}(C)}).

\noindent \textbf{Matrix Factorization-based Methods.} 
Matrix factorization-based methods cluster nodes at each timestamp using matrix factorization while optimizing the temporal smoothness of node embeddings among different timestamps. 
Recently, numerous methods with different strategies have been proposed to improve temporal smoothness. 
For example, sE-NMF**Liu et al., "Smoothed Embedding Nonnegative Matrix Factorization for Dynamic Graphs"**, jLMDC**Jin et al., "Joint Low-Rank and Multi-Graph Diffusion Clustering"**, and NE2NMF**Nguyen et al., "Neural Embeddings 2 Nodes Matrix Factorization for Dynamic Graphs"** estimate temporal smoothness by analyzing topology changes between graphs at the current and previous timestamps, while PisCES**Peng et al., "Progressive Information-Sensitive Community Evolutionary Smoothing"** smooths clusters by considering topology changes across the entire dynamic graph. 
%%%%
In contrast, other methods use clustering metrics or reconstruction loss to measure temporal smoothness. For example, DynaMo**Wang et al., "Dynamically Optimizing Modularity for Dynamic Graph Clustering"** improves temporal smoothness by incrementally maximizing modularity between successive graphs, and PMOEO**Park et al., "Population-based Memetic Evolutionary Optimization for Dynamic Graph Clustering"** and MODPSO**Moon et al., "Memetic Differential Evolution with Population-Size Adaptation for Dynamic Graph Clustering"** employ evolutionary algorithms to minimize the NMI of clusters across different timestamps. %ePMCL**Eh et al., "Evolutionary Pattern Mining for Community Learning"** and HMM-MODCD**Hu et al., "Hidden Markov Model-based Modularity Optimization for Dynamic Graph Clustering"** use hidden Markov models to reconstruct clusters from previous timestamps and capture evolutionary patterns.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Although these methods can simultaneously optimize clustering accuracy and temporal smoothness, they often suffer from low robustness and lack fine-grained node-level temporal smoothing strategies. In this study, we address these issues and enhance robustness, scalability, and practicality for large-scale real-world dynamic graphs.
