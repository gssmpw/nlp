\section{Conclusion}

% In this paper, we propose \texttt{IntegrateX}, an interoperability system that supports efficient cross-chain smart contract invocations with overall atomicity. 
% \texttt{IntegrateX} comprises two protocols and is designed to facilitate efficient complex cross-chain dApps while ensuring atomicity. 
% We introduced an innovative design and conducted comprehensive experiments, with the results indicating that \texttt{IntegrateX} can enhance call efficiency while maintaining atomicity. Moreover, the more complex the cross-chain calls, the more significant the efficiency gains brought by \texttt{IntegrateX}. In certain complex call scenarios, \texttt{IntegrateX} not only improves efficiency but also reduces gas consumption. 
% % In future research, we will focus on enhancing the system's resilience against attacks, as well as further optimizing the efficiency of \texttt{IntegrateX}.

In this paper, we introduce \texttt{IntegrateX}, a system that enhances cross-chain interoperability by ensuring overall atomicity and efficiency in cross-chain smart contract invocations across EVM-compatible blockchains. 
The proposed hybrid cross-chain smart contract deployment protocol enables the logic contract to be cloned and deployed onto a single blockchain efficiently and securely.
The proposed cross-chain smart contract integrated execution protocol allows efficient intra-chain integrated execution for cross-chain smart contract invocations while guarantee overall atomicity. 
% By integrating the execution logic of cross-chain applications onto a single blockchain, IntegrateX reduces the need for multiple rounds of cross-chain execution, addressing inefficiencies related to latency and gas consumption. 
% Our protocols—Hybrid Cross-Chain Smart Contract Deployment and Cross-Chain Smart Contract Integrated Execution—improve performance, concurrency, and scalability. 
Experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art baseline, \texttt{IntegrateX} is able to reduce a significant portion of latency while maintaining low gas cost and high concurrency, particularly excelling in complex cross-chain interactions.
