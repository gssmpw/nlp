In this section, we discuss related works capitalizing  on the Sobolev IPM and Sobolev geometric structure.

\citet{liang2017well_arXiv} leverages Sobolev IPM to study the convergence rate for learning density with the GAN framework. This work shows how convergence rates depend on Sobolev smoothness restrictions within the Sobolev IPM.~\citet{liang2017well_arXiv} also further exploits Sobolev geometry to derive generalization bounds for deep ReLU discriminator networks in GAN. Additionally,~\citet{singh2018nonparametric, liang2021well_jmlr} improve these results under Sobolev IPM by employing the adversarial framework for the analysis. More recently,~\citet{kozdobasobolev} leverages Sobolev norm for unnormalized density estimation.

%Besides,~\citet{uppal2019nonparametric, uppal2020robust} generalize these approaches with Sobolev IPM to the more general Besov IPM.

\citet{nickl2007bracketing} study bracket metric entropy for Sobolev space, which plays a central role in many limit theorems for empirical processes~\citep{dudley1978central, ossiander1987central, andersen1988central}, and for studying convergence rates, lower risk bounds of statistical estimators~\citep{birge1993rates, geer2000empirical}.

Sobolev GAN~\citep{Mroueh-2018-Sobolev} exploits the so-called Sobolev discrepancy to compare probability measures for the GAN framework. More concretely, Sobolev GAN constraints the critic function in IPM within a unit ball defined by the $L^2$-norm of its gradient function with respect to a dominant measure, which shares the same spirit as the Sobolev Wasserstein GAN approach~\citep{xu2020towards}. On the other hand, Fisher GAN~\citep{mroueh2017fisher} constraints the critic function by the $L^2$-norm of itself with respect to a dominant measure. Thus, the Sobolev norm (Equation~\eqref{eq:SobolevNorm}), which integrates information from both critic function and its gradient function, can be regarded as a unification for the approaches in Fisher GAN and Sobolev GAN within the Sobolev IPM problem.

\citet{mroueh2018regularized} proposes the kernelized approach for the Sobolev discrepancy which constraints the critic function of the Sobolev discrepancy within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Then \citet{mroueh2019sobolev} leverages the kernel Sobolev discrepancy to quantify kinetic energy to propose Sobolev descent, i.e., a gradient flow that finds a path of distributions from source to target measures minimizing the kinetic energy. Additionally,~\citet{mroueh2020unbalanced} extend the kernelized approach to unbalanced settings where source and target measures may have different total mass.

\citet{belkin2006manifold} leverages Sobolev norm for manifold regularization in semi-supervised learning (SSL).~\citet{husain2020distributional} studies Sobolev IPM uncertainty set for the distributional robust optimization, and links the distributional robustness with the manifold regularization penalty~\citep{belkin2006manifold}. Additionally,~\citet{mroueh2019sobolev_IC} uses Sobolev discrepancy to propose Sobolev independence criterion for nonlinear feature selection. Furthermore,~\citet{nietert2021smooth} employs Sobolev IPM to analyze theoretical properties for Gaussian-smoothed $p$-Wasserstein distance.

%Intuitively, SIC can be regarded as a gradient-regularized IPM between joint distributions of the two random variables and the product of their marginals, i.e., input measures, which generalizes the mutual information. 

Sobolev transport (ST)~\citep{le2022st} is a scalable variant of OT on a graph, which constraints the Lipschitz condition within the graph-based Sobolev space. Moreover, the $p$-order ST can be considered as a generalization of the Sobolev discrepancy, which constraints the critic function within a unit norm defined by the $L^p$-norm of its gradient. Additionally,~\citet{le2023scalable} extend ST for the unbalanced setting where input measures may have different total mass, while ~\citet{le2024generalized} leverage a class of convex functions to extend ST to more general geometric structures which is beyond its original $L^p$-geometric structure.
